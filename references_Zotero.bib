This is accomplished by a subtle combination of the optimal arrangement of arteries, arterioles and capillaries and the transport mechanisms of convection and diffusion. Elucidating the interaction between cerebral vascular architectonics and the latter physical mechanisms can catalyse progress in treating cerebral pathologies such as stroke, brain tumours, dementia and targeted drug delivery. Here, we show that brain microvascular organization is predicated on commensurate intracapillary oxygen convection and parenchymal diffusion times. Cross-species grey matter results for the rat, cat, rabbit and human reveal very good correlation between the cerebral capillary and tissue mean axial oxygen convective and diffusion time intervals. These findings agree with the constructal principle.},

This problem can be overcome by computing drug sensitivity on a per-division basis. The normalized growth rate inhibition (GR) approach yields per-division metrics for drug potency (GR50) and efficacy (GRmax) that are analogous to the more familiar IC50 and Emax values. In this work, we report GR-based, proliferation-corrected, drug sensitivity metrics for {\textasciitilde}4,700 pairs of breast cancer cell lines and perturbagens. Such data are broadly useful in understanding the molecular basis of therapeutic response and resistance. Here, we use them to investigate the relationship between different measures of drug sensitivity and conclude that drug potency and efficacy exhibit high variation that is only weakly correlated. To facilitate further use of these data, computed GR curves and metrics can be browsed interactively at http://www.GRbrowser.org/.},

The dependency of IC50 and Emax on division rate creates artefactual correlations between genotype and drug sensitivity, while obscuring valuable biological insights and interfering with biomarker discovery. We derive alternative small molecule drug-response metrics that are insensitive to division number. These are based on estimation of the magnitude of drug-induced growth rate inhibition (GR) using endpoint or time-course assays. We show that GR50 and GRmax are superior to conventional metrics for assessing the effects of small molecule drugs in dividing cells. Moreover, adopting GR metrics requires only modest changes in experimental protocols. We expect GR metrics to improve the study of cell signaling and growth using small molecules and biologics and to facilitate the discovery of drug-response biomarkers and the identification of drugs effective against specific patient-derived tumor cells.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: First-generation molecular profiles for human breast cancers have enabled the identification of features that can predict therapeutic response; however, little is known about how the various data types can best be combined to yield optimal predictors. Collections of breast cancer cell lines mirror many aspects of breast cancer molecular pathobiology, and measurements of their omic and biological therapeutic responses are well-suited for development of strategies to identify the most predictive molecular feature sets.
RESULTS: We used least squares-support vector machines and random forest algorithms to identify molecular features associated with responses of a collection of 70 breast cancer cell lines to 90 experimental or approved therapeutic agents. The datasets analyzed included measurements of copy number aberrations, mutations, gene and isoform expression, promoter methylation and protein expression. Transcriptional subtype contributed strongly to response predictors for 25\% of compounds, and adding other molecular data types improved prediction for 65\%. No single molecular dataset consistently out-performed the others, suggesting that therapeutic response is mediated at multiple levels in the genome. Response predictors were developed and applied to TCGA data, and were found to be present in subsets of those patient samples.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that matching patients to treatments based on transcriptional subtype will improve response rates, and inclusion of additional features from other profiling data types may provide additional benefit. Further, we suggest a systems biology strategy for guiding clinical trials so that patient cohorts most likely to respond to new therapies may be more efficiently identified.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Breast cancer cell lines were subjected to cell-viability assays, apoptosis analyses, migration and invasion experiments, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction after exposure to eribulin.
RESULTS: Eribulin reduced cell viability in TNBC and non-TNBC cell lines in the sub-nanomolar range. Furthermore, exposure to eribulin induced apoptosis and decreased the rate of migration and invasion. Genes known to induce malignant transformation were differentially expressed after eribulin treatment.
CONCLUSION: Eribulin had a strong antiproliferative effect on breast cancer cell lines, although we did not observe a significant difference between TNBC and non-TNBC cell lines with regard to sensitivity to eribulin.},

Though cell lines provide unlimited homogenous materials for tumor studies and are relatively easy to culture, they are known to accumulate mutations duringthe initial establishment and subsequent series of cultivations. Thus, whether breast cancer cell line heterogeneity reflects that of carcinoma remains an important issue to resolve before drawing any reliable conclusion at the tumor level using cell lines. Inconsistent nomenclatures used for breast cancer cell line subtyping and the different number of subtypes grouped for cell lines and tumors make their direct matching elusive. By analyzing the molecular features of 92 breast cancer cell lines as documented by different literatures, we categorize 84 cell lines into 5 groups to be consistent with breast tumor classification. After combing through these cell lines, we summarized the molecular features, genetically and epigenetically, of each subtype, and manually documented 10 cell lines lacking explicit information on subtyping. Nine cell lines, either found inconsistent on their primary molecular features from different studies or being contaminated at the origin, are not suggested as the first choice for experimental use. We conclude that breast tumor cell lines, though having a high mutational frequency with many uncertainties and could not fully capture breast cancer heterogeneity, are feasible but crude models for tumors of the same subtype. New cell lines with enriched interferon regulated genes need to be established to enlarge the coverage of cell lines on tumor heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {We consider predator invasions for the nonlocal Holling–Tanner model. Predators are introduced in a small region adjacent to an extensive predator-free region. In its simplest form an invasion front propagates into the predator-free region with a predator–prey coexistence state displacing the predator-free state. However, patterns may form in the wake of the invasion front due to instability of the coexistence state. The coexistence state can be subject to either oscillatory or cellular instability, depending on parameters. Furthermore, the oscillatory instability can be either at zero wave number or finite wave number. In addition, the (unstable) predator-free state can be subject to additional cellular instabilities when the extent of the nonlocality is sufficiently large. We perform numerical simulations that demonstrate that the invasion wave may have a complex structure in which different spatial regions exhibit qualitatively different behaviors. These regions are separated by relatively narrow transition regions that we refer to as fronts. We also derive analytic approximations for the speeds of the fronts and find qualitative and quantitative agreement with the results of computations.},

Examples include the spread of beneficial mutations, chemical reactions, and the invasions by foreign species. In homogeneous environments, the alternative states are separated by a smooth front moving at a constant velocity. This simple picture can break down in structured environments such as tissues, patchy landscapes, and microfluidic devices. Habitat fragmentation can pin the front at a particular location or lock invasion velocities into specific values. Locked velocities are not sensitive to moderate changes in dispersal or growth and are determined by the spatial and temporal periodicity of the environment. The synchronization with the environment results in discontinuous fronts that propagate as periodic pulses. We characterize the transition from continuous to locked invasions and show that it is controlled by positive density-dependence in dispersal or growth. We also demonstrate that velocity locking is robust to demographic and environmental fluctuations and examine stochastic dynamics and evolution in locked invasions.},

We observed rapid accumulation of CNAs during PDX passaging, often due to selection of preexisting minor clones. CNA acquisition in PDXs was correlated with the tissue-specific levels of aneuploidy and genetic heterogeneity observed in primary tumors. However, the particular CNAs acquired during PDX passaging differed from those acquired during tumor evolution in patients. Several CNAs recurrently observed in primary tumors gradually disappeared in PDXs, indicating that events undergoing positive selection in humans can become dispensable during propagation in mice. Notably, the genomic stability of PDXs was associated with their response to chemotherapy and targeted drugs. These findings have major implications for PDX-based modeling of human cancer.},

In particular we consider early vascular growth, just after angiogenesis has occurred. We examine how the geometry of the growing tumour is affected by tumour cell heterogeneity caused by genetic mutations. As the tumour grows, mutations occur leading to a heterogeneous tumour cell population with some cells having a greater ability to migrate, proliferate or degrade the surrounding tissue. All of these cell properties are closely controlled by cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions and as such the physical geometry of the whole tumour will be dependent on these individual cell interactions. The hybrid model we develop focuses on four key variables implicated in the invasion process: tumour cells, host tissue (extracellular matrix), matrix-degradative enzymes and oxygen. The model is considered to be hybrid since the latter three variables are continuous (i.e. concentrations) and the tumour cells are discrete (i.e. individuals). With this hybrid model we examine how individual-based cell interactions (with one another and the matrix) can affect the tumour shape and discuss which of these interactions is perhaps most crucial in influencing the tumour's final structure.},

	abstract = {Tumors are not static masses of cells but dynamic ecosystems where cancer cells experience constant turnover and evolve fitness-enhancing phenotypes. Selection for different phenotypes may vary with (1) the tumor niche (edge or core), (2) cell turnover rates, (3) the nature of the tradeoff between traits, and (4) whether deaths occur in response to demographic or environmental stochasticity. Using a spatially-explicit agent-based model, we observe how two traits (proliferation rate and migration speed) evolve under different tradeoff conditions with different turnover rates. Migration rate is favored over proliferation at the tumor's edge and vice-versa for the interior. Increasing cell turnover rates slightly slows tumor growth but accelerates the rate of evolution for both proliferation and migration. The absence of a tradeoff favors ever higher values for proliferation and migration, while a convex tradeoff tends to favor proliferation, often promoting the coexistence of a generalist and specialist phenotype. A concave tradeoff favors migration at low death rates, but switches to proliferation at higher death rates. Mortality via demographic stochasticity favors proliferation, and environmental stochasticity favors migration. While all of these diverse factors contribute to the ecology, heterogeneity, and evolution of a tumor, their effects may be predictable and empirically accessible.},

Although cell lines are known to evolve in culture, the extent of the resultant genetic and transcriptional heterogeneity and its functional consequences remain understudied. Here we use genomic analyses of 106 human cell lines grown in two laboratories to show extensive clonal diversity. Further comprehensive genomic characterization of 27 strains of the common breast cancer cell line MCF7 uncovered rapid genetic diversification. Similar results were obtained with multiple strains of 13 additional cell lines. Notably, genetic changes were associated with differential activation of gene expression programs and marked differences in cell morphology and proliferation. Barcoding experiments showed that cell line evolution occurs as a result of positive clonal selection that is highly sensitive to culture conditions. Analyses of single-cell-derived clones demonstrated that continuous instability quickly translates into heterogeneity of the cell line. When the 27 MCF7 strains were tested against 321 anti-cancer compounds, we uncovered considerably different drug responses: at least 75\% of compounds that strongly inhibited some strains were completely inactive in others. This study documents the extent, origins and consequences of genetic variation within cell lines, and provides a framework for researchers to measure such variation in efforts to support maximally reproducible cancer research.},

	abstract = {Cancer is a complex, multiscale process, in which genetic mutations occurring at a subcellular level manifest themselves as functional and morphological changes at the cellular and tissue scale. The importance of interactions between tumour cells and their microenvironment is currently of great interest in experimental as well as computational modelling. Both the immediate microenvironment (e.g. cell–cell signalling or cell–matrix interactions) and the extended microenvironment (e.g. nutrient supply or a host tissue structure) are thought to play crucial roles in both tumour progression and suppression. In this paper we focus on tumour invasion, as defined by the emergence of a fingering morphology, which has previously been shown to be dependent upon harsh microenvironmental conditions. Using three different modelling approaches at two different spatial scales we examine the impact of nutrient availability as a driving force for invasion. Specifically we investigate how cell metabolism (the intrinsic rate of nutrient consumption and cell resistance to starvation) influences the growing tumour. We also discuss how dynamical changes in genetic makeup and morphological characteristics, of the tumour population, are driven by extreme changes in nutrient supply during tumour development. The simulation results indicate that aggressive phenotypes produce tumour fingering in poor nutrient, but not rich, microenvironments. The implication of these results is that an invasive outcome appears to be co-dependent upon the evolutionary dynamics of the tumour population driven by the microenvironment.},

	abstract = {Chemotaxis, a biased migration of cells under a chemical gradient, plays a significant role in diverse biological phenomena including cancer metastasis. Stromal cells release signaling proteins to induce chemotaxis, which leads to organ-specific metastasis. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is an example of the chemical attractants, and its gradient stimulates metastasis of breast cancer cells. Hence, the interactions between EGF and breast cancer cells have long been a subject of interest for oncologists and clinicians. However, most current approaches do not systematically separate the effects of gradient and absolute concentration of EGF on chemotaxis of breast cancer cells. In this work, we develop a theoretical model based on signal/noise ratio to represent stochastic properties and report our microfluidic experiments to verify the analytical predictions from the model. The results demonstrate that even under the same EGF concentration gradients (0-50 or 0-150 ng/mL), breast cancer cells reveal a more evident chemotaxis pattern when the absolute EGF concentrations are low. Moreover, we found that reducing the number of EGF receptors (EGFRs) with addition of EGFR antibody (1 ng/mL) can promote chemotaxis at an EGF gradient of 0-1 ng/mL as shown by chemotaxis index (0.121 ± 0.037, reduced EGFRs vs. 0.003 ± 0.041, control). This counterintuitive finding suggests that EGFR-targeted therapy may stimulate metastasis of breast cancer because the partial suppression of the receptors makes the number of receptors close to the optimal one for chemotaxis. This analysis should be considered in anticancer drug design.},

	abstract = {Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a multifunctional growth factor that plays important roles in promoting the invasion and metastasis of various tumor cells. However, there are few reports about the exact mechanisms of HGF involved in the regulation of cell invasion via the induction of COX2. In this study, we found that HGF could activate its receptor c-Met and up-regulate COX2 expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner, which resulted in an increase in MMP-9 expression and subsequent invasiveness of the breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7. The HGF-induced expression of COX2 and MMP-9 and cell invasion were partially suppressed by COX2 gene silencing. The PI3K/Akt and p38 MAPK signaling pathways were activated by HGF in both cell lines. However, PI3K/Akt or p38 MAPK-specific inhibition alone partially attenuated HGF-induced COX2 and MMP-9 expression and the invasiveness of the two breast cancer cell lines, and these HGF-induced effects were almost completely abolished by simultaneous treatment with both inhibitors. Therefore, we concluded that HGF mediates the up-regulation of COX2 predominantly through the PI3K/Akt and p38 MAPK signaling pathways, leading to MMP-9 expression and the subsequent invasion of two breast cancer cell lines. This study improves our understanding of the signal transduction mechanisms in the HGF-induced invasion and progression of breast cancer.},

	abstract = {Rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), inhibits tumor cell motility. However, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we show that rapamycin inhibited type I insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I)-stimulated motility of a panel of cell lines. Expression of a rapamycin-resistant mutant of mTOR (mTORrr) prevented rapamycin inhibition of cell motility. However, cells expressing a kinase-dead mTORrr remained sensitive to rapamycin. Downregulation of raptor or rictor by RNA interference (RNAi) decreased cell motility. However, only downregulation of raptor mimicked the effect of rapamycin, inhibiting phosphorylation of S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) and 4E-BP1. Cells infected with an adenovirus expressing constitutively active and rapamycin-resistant mutant of p70 S6K1, but not with an adenovirus expressing wild-type S6K1, or a control virus, conferred to resistance to rapamycin. Further, IGF-I failed to stimulate motility of the cells, in which S6K1 was downregulated by RNAi. Moreover, downregulation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) by RNAi-attenuated rapamycin inhibition of cell motility. In contrast, expression of constitutively active 4E-BP1 dramatically inhibited IGF-I-stimulated cell motility. The results indicate that both S6K1 and 4E-BP1 pathways, regulated by TORC1, are required for cell motility. Rapamycin inhibits IGF-I-stimulated cell motility, through suppression of both S6K1 and 4E-BP1/eIF4E-signaling pathways, as a consequence of inhibition of mTOR kinase activity.},

	abstract = {Activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling is associated with growth and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). We have previously shown that the mTOR kinase, a downstream effector of PI3K/Akt signaling, regulates tumorigenesis of CRC. However, the contribution of mTOR and its interaction partners toward regulating CRC progression and metastasis remains poorly understood. We found that increased expression of mTOR, Raptor, and Rictor mRNA was noted with advanced stages of CRC, suggesting that mTOR signaling may be associated with CRC progression and metastasis. mTOR, Raptor, and Rictor protein levels were also significantly elevated in primary CRCs (stage IV) and their matched distant metastases compared with normal colon. Inhibition of mTOR signaling, using rapamycin or stable inhibition of mTORC1 (Raptor) and mTORC2 (Rictor), attenuated migration and invasion of CRCs. Furthermore, knockdown of mTORC1 and mTORC2 induced a mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) and enhanced chemosensitivity of CRCs to oxaliplatin. We observed increased cell-cell contact and decreased actin cytoskeletal remodeling concomitant with decreased activation of the small GTPases, RhoA and Rac1, upon inhibition of both mTORC1 and mTORC2. Finally, establishment of CRC metastasis in vivo was completely abolished with targeted inhibition of mTORC1 and mTORC2 irrespective of the site of colonization. Our findings support a role for elevated mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity in regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), motility, and metastasis of CRCs via RhoA and Rac1 signaling. These findings provide the rationale for including mTOR kinase inhibitors, which inhibit both mTORC1 and mTORC2, as part of the therapeutic regimen for CRC patients.},

	abstract = {Glioblastoma is a rapidly evolving high-grade astrocytoma that is distinguished pathologically from lower grade gliomas by the presence of necrosis and microvascular hyperplasia. Necrotic areas are typically surrounded by hypercellular regions known as “pseudopalisades” originated by local tumor vessel occlusions that induce collective cellular migration events. This leads to the formation of waves of tumor cells actively migrating away from central hypoxia. We present a mathematical model that incorporates the interplay among two tumor cell phenotypes, a necrotic core and the oxygen distribution. Our simulations reveal the formation of a traveling wave of tumor cells that reproduces the observed histologic patterns of pseudopalisades. Additional simulations of the model equations show that preventing the collapse of tumor microvessels leads to slower glioma invasion, a fact that might be exploited for therapeutic purposes.},

	abstract = {Glioblastoma (GBM) has explosive biologic properties with rapid clinical progression leading to death. Its distinguishing pathologic features, necrosis with surrounding pseudopalisades and microvascular hyperplasia, are believed to be instrumental to its accelerated growth. Microvascular hyperplasia arises in response to the secretion of proangiogenic factors by hypoxic pseudopalisades and allows for peripheral neoplastic expansion. Mechanisms underlying necrosis and hypoxia remain obscure, but vaso-occlusive and prothrombotic contributions could be substantial. Recent investigations on the origin of pseudopalisades suggest that this morphologic phenomenon is created by a tumor cell population actively migrating away from a central hypoxic region and that, in at least a significant subset, hypoxia-induced migration appears due to vaso-occlusion caused by intravascular thrombosis. Both vascular endothelial growth factor induced vascular permeability to plasma coagulation factors and the increased neoplastic expression of tissue factor likely contribute to a prothrombotic state favoring intravascular thrombosis. In addition to prothrombotic mechanisms, vaso-occlusion could also result from angiopoietin-2-mediated endothelial cell apoptosis and vascular regression, which follows neoplastic co-option of native vessels in animal models of gliomas. Vaso-occlusive and prothrombotic mechanisms in GBM could readily explain the presence of pseudopalisades and coagulative necrosis in tissue sections, the emergence of central contrast enhancement and its rapid peripheral expansion on neuroimaging, and the dramatic shift to an accelerated rate of clinical progression. Since the hypoxic induction of angiogenesis appears to support further neoplastic growth, therapeutic targeting of the underlying vascular pathology and thrombosis could provide a new means to prolong time to progression.},

	abstract = {Development of necrosis is a characteristic feature of glioblastoma but its pathogenesis remains poorly understood. The process of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in response to DNA damage is mediated by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and results in NAD+ depletion. The consequent ATP and energy depletion may result in cell necrosis. Therefore PARP activation is a potential candidate for a regulatory role in the pathogenesis of necrosis in glioblastoma. This study investigated whether there might be a relationship between both PARP expression and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, and necrosis in glioblastoma. The pattern of expression of PARP and of poly(ADP-ribose) groups in an archival series of glioblastoma was examined using immunohistochemistry. These parameters were also studied in multicellular tumour spheroids, derived from human glioma cell lines in which central necrosis develops with increasing spheroid diameter. Poly(ADP-ribose) groups were expressed in peri-necrotic tumour cells in glioblastoma. In the spheroid model poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation was seen centrally in pre-necrotic and necrotic cells with increasing spheroid diameter. PARP was widely expressed in viable tumour cells in the glioblastoma sections. In the spheroids, PARP expression, which was initially diffuse, became confined to the outer proliferative zone with increasing diameter. The pattern of expression of poly(ADP-ribose) groups in the spheroids and in glioblastoma raises the possibility that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation may play a role in the development of necrosis in glioma. The high basal PARP expression in both glioblastoma and the spheroids suggests that this enzyme may have additional roles in glioma cell biology.},

While they were unable to statistically significantly demonstrate that bevacizumab in combination with other therapies increases the overall survival of GBM patients, there remains a question of potential benefits for subpopulations of patients. We use a mathematical model of GBM growth to investigate differential benefits of combining surgical resection, radiation and bevacizumab across observed tumour growth kinetics. The differential hypoxic burden after gross total resection (GTR) was assessed along with the change in radiation cell kill from bevacizumab-induced tissue re-normalization when starting therapy for tumours at different diagnostic sizes. Depending on the tumour size at the time of treatment, our model predicted that GTR would remove a variable portion of the hypoxic burden ranging from 11\% to 99.99\%. Further, our model predicted that the combination of bevacizumab with radiation resulted in an additional cell kill ranging from 2.6×10(7) to 1.1×10(10) cells. By considering the outcomes given individual tumour kinetics, our results indicate that the subpopulation of patients who would receive the greatest benefit from bevacizumab and radiation combination therapy are those with large, aggressive tumours and who are not eligible for GTR.},

	abstract = {Gliomas are uniformly fatal forms of primary brain neoplasms that vary from low-grade to high-grade (glioblastoma). While low-grade gliomas are weakly angiogenic, glioblastomas are among the most angiogenic of tumors. Thus, interactions between glioma cells and their tissue microenvironment may play an important role in aggressive tumor formation and progression. To quantitatively explore how tumor cells interact with their tissue microenvironment, we incorporated the interactions of normoxic glioma cells, hypoxic glioma cells, vascular endothelial cells, diffusible angiogenic factors, and necrosis formation into a first-generation, biologically-based mathematical model for glioma growth and invasion. Model simulations quantitatively described the spectrum of in vivo dynamics of gliomas visualized with medical imaging. Further, we investigated how proliferation and dispersal of glioma cells combine to induce increasing degrees of cellularity, mitoses, hypoxia-induced neo-angiogenesis and necrosis, features that characterize increasing degrees of “malignancy”, and we found that changes in the net rates of proliferation (\{lower case rho\}) and invasion (D) are not always necessary for malignant progression. Thus, although other factors, including the accumulation of genetic mutations, can change cellular phenotype (e.g. proliferation and invasion rates), this study suggests that these are not required for malignant progression. Simulated results are placed in the context of the current clinical World Health Organization grading scheme for studying specific patient examples. This study suggests that through the application of the proposed model for tumor-microenvironment interactions, predictable patterns of dynamic changes in glioma histology distinct from changes in cellular phenotype (e.g. proliferation and invasion rates) may be identified, thus providing a powerful clinical tool.},

	abstract = {Nonequilibrium ecology and resilience theory have transformed rangeland ecology and management by challenging the traditional assumptions of ecological stability and linear successional dynamics. These alternative interpretations indicate that ecosystem dynamics are strongly influenced by disturbance, heterogeneity, and existence of multiple stable states. The nonequilibrium persistent model indicates that plant production and livestock numbers are seldom in equilibrium in pastoral systems because reoccurring drought maintains livestock number below the ecological carrying capacity. However, it has recently been demonstrated that livestock are often in equilibrium with key dry-season resources, even though they may only be loosely coupled to abundant wet-season resources. Similarly, state-and-transition models were initially influenced by nonequilibrium ecology, but they have subsequently been organized around resilience theory to represent both equilibrial dynamics within states and existence of multiple states. Resilience theory was introduced to describe how ecosystems can be dynamic, but still persist as self-organized systems. It envisions that community structure is maintained by ecological processes representing feedback mechanisms and controlling variables to moderate community fluctuation in response to disturbance. Appropriate qualification of equilibrium ecology within resilience theory, rather than its complete replacement by nonequilibrium models, provides more realistic interpretations for both plant–herbivore interactions and vegetation dynamics than does complete reliance on disturbance-driven events. Resilience thinking represents a “humans-in-nature” perspective that emphasizes human values and goals and it seeks to guide change in social-ecological systems by creating opportunities for multiple stakeholders to adaptively design management strategies and policies.},

	abstract = {The effects of disturbance on local species diversity were investigated in an algaldominated intertidal boulder field in southern California. In this habitat, the major form of disturbance occurs when waves, generated by winter storms, overturn boulders. These natural physical disturbances open space, interrupt successional sequences, and determine local levels of species diversity. Because small boulders are more frequently overturned than larger ones, the plants and sessile animals of boulder fields are distributed in a patchwork of successional stages. Boulders which are subjected to intermediate disturbance frequencies are usually less dominated than those which are very frequently disturbed, and always less dominated than those which are seldon disturbed. In all seasons most small boulders have fewer species than those of intermediate size. Large boulders also usually have fewer species, except in the spring, when defoliation of the algal canopy during the previous winter has opened space for colonization. Species richness on these boulders declines during summer months, and is less than that on boulders of intermediate size in the fall. Small boulders, with a shorter disturbance interval, support only sparse early successional communities of the green alga, Ulva, and barnacles. Large, infrequently disturbed boulders are dominated by the late successional red alga, Gigartina canaliculata. Intermediate-sized boulders support the most diverse communities composed of Ulva, barnacles, several middle successional species of red algae, and Gigartina canaliculata. Comparison of the pattern of succession on experimentally stabilized boulders with that on unstable ones confirms that differences in the frequency of disturbances are responsible for the above patterns of species composition. The frequency of disturbance also determines the degree of between-boulder variation in species composition and diversity. Small boulders which are frequently overturned sample the available pool of spores and larvae more often. As a result, a greater number of different species occur as single dominants on these boulders. Boulders with an intermediate probability of being disturbed are most variable in species diversity. Assemblages on these boulders range from being dominated by a single species to being very diverse while most communities on boulders which are frequently or seldom disturbed are strongly dominated. Observations on the local densities of three species of middle successional red algae over two year-long periods indicate that most of these are variable in time. More local populations went extinct or became newly established on boulders than remained constant in size. These species persist globally in the boulder field mosaic by colonizing recent openings created by disturbances. These results lend support to a nonequilibrium view of community structure and, along with other studies suggest that disturbances which open space are necessary for the maintenance of diversity in most communities of sessile organisms.},

Further, we demonstrated that HIF-1α/miR-26a axis strengthened the acquisition of TMZ resistance through prevention of Bax and Bad in mitochondria dysfunction in GBM. In addition, miR-26a expression levels negatively correlate with Bax, Bad levels, and GBM progression; but highly correlate with HIF-1α levels in clinical cancer tissues.

	title = {Mechanisms of hepatocyte growth factor-induced retinal endothelial cell migration and growth},
	volume = {41},
	issn = {0146-0404},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), also called scatter factor, stimulates growth and motility in nonocular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells through its receptor c-Met. Recent reports suggest that HGF is increased in the serum and vitreous of patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy and that smooth muscle cells and retinal pigment epithelial cells secrete HGF in the eye. However, little is known about HGF's action in the retina. In this study, the activity, expression, and signaling pathways of HGF were investigated in bovine retinal microvascular endothelial cells (BRECs).
METHODS: Mitogenic and motogeneic effects of HGF on BRECs were examined using cell counts, thymidine uptake, and migration assays. MAP kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation was examined by Western blot analysis. Protein kinase C (PKC), MAPK, and PI3 kinase involvement were evaluated using selective inhibitors and activity assays. Expression of HGF and c-Met was evaluated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: HGF and c-Met were both expressed in BRECs. HGF stimulated BREC growth in a time- and dose-dependent manner, observed at HGF concentrations of 5 ng/ml or more and maximal (410\%) at 100 ng/ml (P {\textless} 0.001). HGF increased BREC migration in a dose-dependent manner with a maximal 3.4-fold increase at 50 ng/ml after 5 hours. HGF induced time- and dose-dependent MAPK phosphorylation, initially evident at 5 minutes (P {\textless} 0.001) or 5 ng/ml (P {\textless} 0.050) and maximal after 15 minutes ({\textgreater}80-fold, P {\textless} 0.001) or 50 ng/ml ({\textgreater}20-fold, P {\textless} 0.001), respectively. MAPK phosphorylation was maintained for more than 2 hours. This response was inhibited 31\% by 0.1 microm wortmannin and 76\% by 30 microm LY294002, another PI3 kinase inhibitor. The non-isoform-selective PKC inhibitor GFX inhibited HGF-induced MAPK phosphorylation by only 15\% at 5 microm. Combined PKC and PI3 kinase inhibition was additive (P {\textless} 0.05). Cell migration was inhibited 30\% by wortmannin (P {\textless} 0.01) and 32\% by GFX (P {\textless} 0.05), and again the effect was additive (P {\textless} 0.001). HGF-induced BREC growth was suppressed by PI3 kinase, PKC, or MAPK inhibition (all P {\textless} 0.01). HGF (50 ng/ml) stimulated PI3 kinase activity 347\% (P {\textless} 0.001) and PKC activity 37\% (P {\textless} 0.05). HGF-induced MAPK phosphorylation and mitogenesis were not inhibited by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-neutralizing antibody.
CONCLUSIONS: HGF and its receptor are expressed in BREC, and HGF stimulates both BREC growth and migration at concentrations observed in the human eye with diabetic retinopathy. HGF signaling appears to involve activation of both PKC and PI3 kinase, inducing MAPK phosphorylation that is critical for migration and growth. However, VEGF does not appear to mediate these initial HGF effects. These results indicate that HGF could have a significant role in mediating retinal endothelial cell proliferation and migration in diabetic retinopathy, and they begin to elucidate the signal transduction pathway by which this action may occur.},

	abstract = {Polyploid giant cancer cells (PGCCs) have been observed by pathologists for over a century. PGCCs contribute to solid tumor heterogeneity, but their functions are largely undefined. Little attention has been given to these cells, largely because PGCCs have been generally thought to originate from repeated failure of mitosis/cytokinesis and have no capacity for long-term survival or proliferation. Here we report our successful purification and culture of PGCCs from human ovarian cancer cell lines and primary ovarian cancer. These cells are highly resistant to oxygen deprivation and could form through endoreduplication or cell fusion, generating regular-sized cancer cells quickly through budding or bursting similar to simple organisms like fungi. They express normal and cancer stem cell markers, they divide asymmetrically and they cycle slowly. They can differentiate into adipose, cartilage and bone. A single PGCC formed cancer spheroids in vitro and generated tumors in immunodeficient mice. These PGCC-derived tumors gained a mesenchymal phenotype with increased expression of cancer stem cell markers CD44 and CD133 and become more resistant to treatment with cisplatin. Taken together, our results reveal that PGCCs represent a resistant form of human cancer using an ancient, evolutionarily conserved mechanism in response to hypoxia stress; they can contribute to the generation of cancer stem-like cells, and also play a fundamental role in regulating tumor heterogeneity, tumor growth and chemoresistance in human cancer.},

While in most cases, we still do not know why cancer is lethal, we know that a total tumor burden of 1 kg—equivalent to one trillion cells—is not compatible with life. While localized disease is curable through surgical removal or radiation, once cancer has spread, it is largely incurable. The inability to cure metastatic cancer lies, at least in part, to the fact that cancer is resistant to all known compounds and anticancer drugs. The source of this resistance remains undefined. In fact, the vast majority of metastatic cancers are resistant to all currently available anticancer therapies, including chemotherapy, hormone therapy, immunotherapy, and systemic radiation. Thus, despite decades—even centuries—of research, metastatic cancer remains lethal and incurable. We present historical and contemporary evidence that the key actuators of this process—of tumorigenesis, metastasis, and therapy resistance—are polyploid giant cancer cells.},

Over time, the dynamic tumor ecosystem is exposed to extreme, catastrophic changes in the conditions of the tumor—natural (e.g., loss of blood supply) or imposed (therapeutic). While the nature of these catastrophes may be varied or unique, their common property may be to doom the current cancer phenotype unless it evolves rapidly. Poly-aneuploid cancer cells (PACCs) may serve as efficient sources of heritable variation that allows cancer cells to evolve rapidly, speciate, evolutionarily track their environment, and most critically for patient outcome and survival, permit evolutionary rescue, therapy resistance, and metastasis. As a conditional evolutionary strategy, they permit the cancer cells to accelerate evolution under stress and slow down the generation of heritable variation when conditions are more favorable or when the cancer cells are closer to an evolutionary optimum. We hypothesize that they play a critical and outsized role in lethality by their increased capacity for invasion and motility, for enduring novel and stressful environments, and for generating heritable variation that can be dispensed to their 2N+ aneuploid progeny that make up the bulk of cancer cells within a tumor, providing population rescue in response to therapeutic stress. Targeting PACCs is essential to cancer therapy and patient cure—without the eradication of the resilient PACCs, cancer will recur in treated patients.},

However, despite its prevalence and prognostic relevance, the evolutionary selection pressures for WGD in cancer have not been investigated. Here, we combine evolutionary simulations with an analysis of cancer sequencing data to explore WGD during cancer evolution. Simulations suggest that WGD can be selected to mitigate the irreversible, ratchet-like, accumulation of deleterious somatic alterations, provided that they occur at a sufficiently high rate. Consistent with this, we observe an enrichment for WGD in tumor types with extensive loss of heterozygosity, including lung squamous cell carcinoma and triple-negative breast cancers, and we find evidence for negative selection against homozygous loss of essential genes before, but not after, WGD. Finally, we demonstrate that loss of heterozygosity and temporal dissection of mutations can be exploited to identify novel tumor suppressor genes and to obtain a deeper characterization of known cancer genes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The growth of new blood vessels in adult life requires the initiation of endothelial cell migration and proliferation from pre-existing vessels in addition to the recruitment and differentiation of circulating endothelial progenitor cells. Signals emanating from growth factors and the extracellular matrix are important in regulating these processes.
RESULTS: Here we report that fibronectin (FN) and vitronectin (VN) modulate the responses of endothelial cells to HGF (Scatter Factor), an important pro-angiogenic mediator. Novel binding sites for HGF were identified on both FN and VN that generate molecular complexes with enhanced biological activity and these were identified in the supernatants of degranulated platelet suspensions implicating their release and formation in vivo. In the absence of co-stimulation with an ECM glycoprotein, HGF could not promote endothelial cell migration but retained the capacity to induce a proliferative response utilising the Map kinase pathway. Through promoting Met-Integrin association, HGF-FN and HGF-VN complexes coordinated and enhanced endothelial cell migration through activation of the PI-3 kinase pathway involving a Ras-dependent mechanism whereas a Ras-independent and attenuated migratory response was promoted by co-stimulation of cells with HGF and a non-binding partner ECM glycoprotein such as collagen-1.
CONCLUSIONS: These studies identify a novel mechanism and pathway of HGF signalling in endothelial cells involving cooperation between Met and integrins in a Ras dependent manner. These findings have implications for the regulation of neovascularization in both health and disease.},

	abstract = {Multidomain proteins of the extracellular matrix (ECM) play an important role in development and maintenance of cellular organization and in tissue repair. Several ECM proteins such as laminin, tenascin and thrombospondin contain domains with homology to epidermal growth factor (EGF) and exhibit growth promoting activity. The mitogenic activity of laminin is restricted to a fragment which consists of about 25 repeating domains with partial homology to EGF and comprises the rod-like inner regions of the three short arms of the four armed molecule. The mitogenic activity does not correlate with promotion of cell attachment and neurite outgrowth for which major functional sites have been found in other regions of the laminin molecule. It is suggested that EGF-like domains in laminin, in other ECM proteins and in the extracellular portions of some membrane proteins are signals for cellular growth and differentiation. Because they are integral parts of large molecules and often of supramolecular assemblies these domains are well suited to stimulate neighboring cells in a specific and vectorial way. This concept of localized growth or differentiation signals offers an attractive mechanism for the regulation of cellular development.},

We then conducted exome-sequencing on the isolated nuclei and mRNA-sequencing on the enucleated cytoplasm. For single oocytes, exome-seq can cover up to 92\% of exome region with an average sequencing depth of 10+, while mRNA-sequencing reveals more than 10,000 expressed genes in enucleated cytoplasm, with similar performance for intact oocytes. This approach provides unprecedented opportunities to study DNA-RNA regulation, such as RNA editing at single nucleotide level in oocytes.

With deep sequencing technologies, this question is taking on a new form: given a time-series of the frequency of different variants in a population, what is the likelihood that the observation has arisen due to selection or neutrality? To tackle the 2-variant case, we exploit Fisher’s angular transformation, which despite being discovered by Ronald Fisher a century ago, has remained an intellectual curiosity. We show together with a heuristic approach it provides a simple solution for the transition probability density at short times, including drift, selection and mutation. Our results show under that under strong selection and sufficiently frequent sampling these evolutionary parameters can be accurately determined from simulation data and so they provide a theoretical basis for techniques to detect selection from variant or polymorphism frequency time-series.},

	abstract = {The co-evolutionary dynamics of competing populations can be strongly affected by frequency-dependent selection and spatial population structure. As co-evolving populations grow into a spatial domain, their initial spatial arrangement and their growth rate differences are important factors that determine the long-term outcome. We here model producer and free-rider co-evolution in the context of a diffusive public good (PG) that is produced by the producers at a cost but evokes local concentration-dependent growth benefits to all. The benefit of the PG can be non-linearly dependent on public good concentration. We consider the spatial growth dynamics of producers and free-riders in one, two and three dimensions by modeling producer cell, free-rider cell and public good densities in space, driven by the processes of birth, death and diffusion (cell movement and public good distribution). Typically, one population goes extinct, but the time-scale of this process varies with initial conditions and the growth rate functions. We establish that spatial variation is transient regardless of dimensionality, and that structured initial conditions lead to increasing times to get close to an extinction state, called ε-extinction time. Further, we find that uncorrelated initial spatial structures do not influence this ε-extinction time in comparison to a corresponding well-mixed (non-spatial) system. In order to estimate the ε-extinction time of either free-riders or producers we derive a slow manifold solution. For invading populations, i.e. for populations that are initially highly segregated, we observe a traveling wave, whose speed can be calculated. Our results provide quantitative predictions for the transient spatial dynamics of cooperative traits under pressure of extinction.},

	abstract = {The cell cycle is the fundamental process of cell populations, it is regulated by environmental cues and by intracellular checkpoints. Cell cycle variability in clonal cell population is caused by stochastic processes such as random partitioning of cellular components to progeny cells at division and random interactions among biomolecules in cells. One of the important biological questions is how the dynamics at the cell cycle scale, which is related to family dependencies between the cell and its descendants, affects cell population behavior in the long-run. We address this question using a “mechanistic” model, built based on observations of single cells over several cell generations, and then extrapolated in time. We used cell pedigree observations of NIH 3T3 cells including FUCCI markers, to determine patterns of inheritance of cell-cycle phase durations and single-cell protein dynamics. Based on that information we developed a hybrid mathematical model, involving bifurcating autoregression to describe stochasticity of partitioning and inheritance of cell-cycle-phase times, and an ordinary differential equation system to capture single-cell protein dynamics. Long-term simulations, concordant with in vitro experiments, demonstrated the model reproduced the main features of our data and had homeostatic properties. Moreover, heterogeneity of cell cycle may have important consequences during population development. We discovered an effect similar to genetic drift, amplified by family relationships among cells. In consequence, the progeny of a single cell with a short cell cycle time had a high probability of eventually dominating the population, due to the heritability of cell-cycle phases. Patterns of epigenetic heritability in proliferating cells are important for understanding long-term trends of cell populations which are either required to provide the influx of maturing cells (such as hematopoietic stem cells) or which started proliferating uncontrollably (such as cancer cells).},

However, there is overwhelming evidence in some malignancies that the tumor clone is heterogeneous with respect to proliferation and differentiation. In human leukemia, the tumor clone is organized as a hierarchy that originates from rare leukemic stem cells that possess extensive proliferative and self-renewal potential, and are responsible for maintaining the tumor clone. We report here the identification and purification of a cancer stem cell from human brain tumors of different phenotypes that possesses a marked capacity for proliferation, self-renewal, and differentiation. The increased self-renewal capacity of the brain tumor stem cell (BTSC) was highest from the most aggressive clinical samples of medulloblastoma compared with low-grade gliomas. The BTSC was exclusively isolated with the cell fraction expressing the neural stem cell surface marker CD133. These CD133+ cells could differentiate in culture into tumor cells that phenotypically resembled the tumor from the patient. The identification of a BTSC provides a powerful tool to investigate the tumorigenic process in the central nervous system and to develop therapies targeted to the BTSC.},

Here we describe Gboxin, a small molecule that specifically inhibits the growth of primary mouse and human glioblastoma cells but not that of mouse embryonic fibroblasts or neonatal astrocytes. Gboxin rapidly and irreversibly compromises oxygen consumption in glioblastoma cells. Gboxin relies on its positive charge to associate with mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complexes in a manner that is dependent on the proton gradient of the inner mitochondrial membrane, and it inhibits the activity of F0F1 ATP synthase. Gboxin-resistant cells require a functional mitochondrial permeability transition pore that regulates pH and thus impedes the accumulation of Gboxin in the mitochondrial matrix. Administration of a metabolically stable Gboxin analogue inhibits glioblastoma allografts and patient-derived xenografts. Gboxin toxicity extends to established human cancer cell lines of diverse organ origin, and shows that the increased proton gradient and pH in cancer cell mitochondria is a mode of action that can be targeted in the development of antitumour reagents.},

	doi = {10.1093/annonc/mdy506},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive adult brain malignancy against which conventional surgery and chemoradiation provide limited benefit. Even when a good treatment response is obtained, recurrence inevitably occurs either locally (∼80\%) or distally (∼20\%), driven by cancer clones that are often genomically distinct from those in the primary tumour. Glioblastoma cells display a characteristic infiltrative phenotype, invading the surrounding tissue and often spreading across the whole brain. Cancer cells responsible for relapse can reside in two compartments of residual disease that are left behind after treatment: the infiltrated normal brain parenchyma and the sub-ventricular zone. However, these two sources of residual disease in glioblastoma are understudied because of the difficulty in sampling these regions during surgery.
PATIENT AND METHODS: Here, we present the results of whole-exome sequencing of 69 multi-region samples collected using fluorescence-guided resection from 11 patients, including the infiltrating tumour margin and the sub-ventricular zone for each patient, as well as matched blood. We used a phylogenomic approach to dissect the spatio-temporal evolution of each tumour and unveil the relation between residual disease and the main tumour mass. We also analysed two patients with paired primary-recurrence samples with matched residual disease.
RESULTS: Our results suggest that infiltrative subclones can arise early during tumour growth in a subset of patients. After treatment, the infiltrative subclones may seed the growth of a recurrent tumour, thus representing the 'missing link' between the primary tumour and recurrent disease.
CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with recognised clinical phenotypic behaviour and suggest that more specific therapeutic targeting of cells in the infiltrated brain parenchyma may improve patient's outcome.},

Ultimately, however, the remaining tumor is rescued by robust angiogenesis at the tumor margin.

	abstract = {Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly malignant, rapidly progressive astrocytoma that is distinguished pathologically from lower grade tumors by necrosis and microvascular hyperplasia. Necrotic foci are typically surrounded by "pseudopalisading" cells-a configuration that is relatively unique to malignant gliomas and has long been recognized as an ominous prognostic feature. Precise mechanisms that relate morphology to biologic behavior have not been described. Recent investigations have demonstrated that pseudopalisades are severely hypoxic, overexpress hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1), and secrete proangiogenic factors such as VEGF and IL-8. Thus, the microvascular hyperplasia in GBM that provides a new vasculature and promotes peripheral tumor expansion is tightly linked with the emergence of pseudopalisades. Both pathologic observations and experimental evidence have indicated that the development of hypoxia and necrosis within astrocytomas could arise secondary to vaso-occlusion and intravascular thrombosis. This emerging model suggests that pseudopalisades represent a wave of tumor cells actively migrating away from central hypoxia that arises after a vascular insult. Experimental glioma models have shown that endothelial apoptosis, perhaps resulting from angiopoetin-2, initiates vascular pathology, whereas observations in human tumors have clearly demonstrated that intravascular thrombosis develops with high frequency in the transition to GBM. Tissue factor, the main cellular initiator of thrombosis, is dramatically upregulated in response to PTEN loss and hypoxia in human GBM and could promote a prothrombotic environment that precipitates these events. A prothrombotic environment also activates the family of protease activated receptors (PARs) on tumor cells, which are G-protein-coupled and enhance invasive and proangiogenic properties. Vaso-occlusive and prothrombotic mechanisms in GBM could readily explain the presence of pseudopalisading necrosis in tissue sections, the rapid peripheral expansion on neuroimaging, and the dramatic shift to an accelerated rate of clinical progression resulting from hypoxia-induced angiogenesis.},

To overcome these limitations, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing on 38 296 glioblastoma cells and 22 637 normal human fetal brain cells. Using an unbiased approach, we mapped the lineage hierarchy of the developing human brain and compared the transcriptome of each cancer cell to this roadmap. We discovered a conserved neural trilineage cancer hierarchy with glial progenitor-like cells at the apex. We also found that this progenitor population contains the majority of cancer’s cycling cells and is the origin of heterogeneity. Finally, we show that this hierarchal map can be used to identify therapeutic targets specific to progenitor cancer stem cells.

	abstract = {Purpose: Bevacizumab targets VEGF-A and has proved beneficial in glioma patients, improving clinical symptoms by the reduction of tumor edema. However, it remains controversial whether or not bevacizumab exerts antitumor effects in addition to (and potentially independent of) its effects on tumor vessels, and it is unknown what doses are needed to achieve this.
Experimental Design: We established a novel orthotopic glioma mouse model that allowed us to simultaneously study the kinetics of the morphologic and functional vascular changes, tumor growth, and the viability of individual tumor cells during the course of anti-VEGF therapy in the same microscopic tumor region in real-time. Three doses of bevacizumab were compared, a subclinical dose and two clinical doses (medium and high).
Results: Low (subclinical) doses of bevacizumab led to a significant reduction of the total vascular volume without affecting tumor cell viability or the overall tumor growth rates. Medium and high doses triggered a similar degree of vascular regression but significantly decreased tumor growth and prolonged survival. Remaining vessels revealed morphologic features of vascular normalization, reduced permeability, and an increase in blood flow velocity; the latter was dose dependent. We observed an uncoupling of the antitumoral and the antivascular effects of bevacizumab with the high dose only, which showed the potential to cause microregional glioma cell regression. In some tumor regions, pronounced glioma cell regression occurred even without vascular regression. In vitro, there was no effect of bevacizumab on glioma cell proliferation.
Conclusions: Regression of glioma cells can occur independently from vascular regression, suggesting that high doses of bevacizumab have indirect anticancer cell properties in vivo. Clin Cancer Res; 17(19); 6192–205. ©2011 AACR.},

	abstract = {Programmed cell death is crucial for the development and maintenance of multicellular organisms. The decision to live, or to die, depends, at the cellular level, upon the cell's interaction with extracellular cues that trigger cell signaling pathways promoting survival or death. The extracellular matrix (ECM) influences the execution of the apoptotic program through the actions of adhesion receptors. Among these, integrins initiate a variety of downstream signaling events in response to ECM ligation. Integrins directly activate survival pathways via the PI 3-kinase and MAPK pathways and act as essential cofactors for their stimulation by growth factors. Conversely, elevated integrin expression in the absence of appropriate ligands, or in the presence of natural or synthetic antagonists, can promote apoptosis under otherwise permissive growth conditions. Integrins thus act in a crucial biosensory role, coordinating survival or death responses as a function of ECM composition. This dual function provides an elegant mechanism through which tissue-remodeling events may regulate cell death or survival in a temporal, ECM-governed manner.},

Engagement of integrins with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins can activate members of the Rho-family of small GTPases; conversely, Rho- and Ras-family proteins can influence the ability of integrins to bind their ligands. These events impinge on the control of cell motility, and ultimately on invasive and metastatic behavior. Integrin engagement with ECM also has important effects on cell survival, particularly for cells of epithelial origin. In some cases, specific integrins have selective effects on the efficiency of signal transduction in cell survival pathways.},

	abstract = {Transduction of signals initiating motility by extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules differed depending on the type of matrix molecule and whether the ligand was in solution or bound to a substratum. Laminin, fibronectin, and type IV collagen stimulated both chemotaxis and haptotaxis of the A2058 human melanoma cell line. Peak chemotactic responses were reached at 50-200 nM for laminin, 50-100 nM for fibronectin, and 200-370 nM for type IV collagen. Checkerboard analysis of each attractant in solution demonstrated a predominantly directional (chemotactic) response, with a minor chemokinetic component. The cells also migrated in a concentration-dependent manner to insoluble step gradients of substratum-bound attractant (haptotaxis). The haptotactic responses reached maximal levels at coating concentrations of 20 nM for laminin and type IV collagen, and from 30 to 45 nM for fibronectin. Pretreatment of cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (5 micrograms/ml), resulted in a 5-30\% inhibition of both chemotactic and haptotactic responses to each matrix protein, indicating that de novo protein synthesis was not required for a significant motility response. Pretreatment of cells with 50-500 micrograms/ml of synthetic peptides containing the fibronectin cell-recognition sequence GRGDS resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of fibronectin-mediated chemotaxis and haptotaxis (70-80\% inhibition compared to control motility); negative control peptide GRGES had only a minimal effect. Neither GRGDS nor GRGES significantly inhibited motility to laminin or type IV collagen. Therefore, these results support a role for the RGD-directed integrin receptor in both types of motility response to fibronectin. After pretreatment with pertussis toxin (PT), chemotactic responses to laminin, fibronectin, and type IV collagen were distinctly different. Chemotaxis to laminin was intermediate in sensitivity; chemotaxis to fibronectin was completely insensitive; and chemotaxis to type IV collagen was profoundly inhibited by PT. In marked contrast to the inhibition of chemotaxis, the hepatotactic responses to all three ligands were unaffected by any of the tested concentrations of PT. High concentrations of cholera toxin (CT; 10 micrograms/ml) or the cAMP analogue, 8-Br-cAMP (0.5 mM), did not significantly affect chemotactic or haptotactic motility to any of the attractant proteins, ruling out the involvement of cAMP in the biochemical pathway initiating motility in these cells. The sensitivity of chemotaxis induced by laminin and type IV collagen, but not fibronectin, to PT indicates the involvement of a PT-sensitive G protein in transduction of the signals initiating motility to soluble laminin and type IV collagen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	abstract = {Hyaluronan is a major carbohydrate component of the extracellular matrix and can be found in skin, joints, eyes and most other organs and tissues. It has a simple, repeated disaccharide linear copolymer structure that is completely conserved throughout a large span of the evolutionary tree, indicating a fundamental biological importance. Amongst extracellular matrix molecules, it has unique hygroscopic, rheological and viscoelastic properties. Hyaluronan binds to many other extracellular matrix molecules, binds specifically to cell bodies through cell surface receptors, and has a unique mode of synthesis in which the molecule is extruded immediately into the extracellular space upon formation. Through its complex interactions with matrix components and cells, hyaluronan has multifaceted roles in biology utilizing both its physicochemical and biological properties. These biological roles range from a purely structural function in the extracellular matrix to developmental regulation through effects of cellular behavior via control of the tissue macro- and microenvironments, as well as through direct receptor mediated effects on gene expression. Hyaluronan is also thought to have important biological roles in skin wound healing, by virtue of its presence in high amounts in skin. Hyaluronan content in skin is further elevated transiently in granulation tissue during the wound healing process. In this review, the general physicochemical and biological properties of hyaluronan, and how these properties may be utilized in the various processes of wound healing: inflammation, granulation and reepithelization, are presented.},

The matrix macromolecule hyaluronan (HA) and various cytokines, including members of the TGF-beta family, have been implicated in the control of scarring. We have previously reported that adult and fetal fibroblasts differ with respect to the effect of cell density on HA synthesis when cultured on plastic tissue culture dishes. Data regarding the effects of substratum and TGF-beta1 on HA synthesis by these cells are presented in this communication. Our results indicate that HA synthesis by both fetal and adult fibroblasts is (a) up-regulated by culture on a collagen substratum and (b) differentially regulated by TGF-beta1 in a manner which is dependent upon both substratum and cell density. TGF-beta1 stimulated HA synthesis by confluent fetal fibroblasts growing on a plastic substratum, but inhibited HA synthesis on a collagen substratum; these data underscore the important role of the substratum in determining the precise effect of TGF-beta1 on cell behavior. Related studies indicated that the migration of fetal and adult fibroblasts into the collagen substrata was modulated by TGF-beta1 in a manner identical to its effect on HA synthesis. These observations are discussed in terms of the contribution of distinct fibroblast subpopulations to wound healing and the manner in which this is regulated by matrix and cytokines.},

	doi = {10.1089/ars.2013.5713},
	abstract = {SIGNIFICANCE: Rho GTPases are historically known to be central regulators of actin cytoskeleton reorganization. This affects many processes including cell migration. In addition, members of the Rac subfamily are known to be involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production through the regulation of NADPH oxidase (Nox) activity. This review focuses on relationships between Nox-regulated ROS, Rho GTPases, and cytoskeletal reorganization, in the context of cell migration.
RECENT ADVANCES: It has become clear that ROS participate in the regulation of certain Rho GTPase family members, thus mediating cytoskeletal reorganization.
CRITICAL ISSUES: The role of the actin cytoskeleton in providing a scaffold for components of the Nox complex needs to be examined in the light of these new advances. During cell migration, Rho GTPases, ROS, and cytoskeletal organization appear to function as a complex regulatory network. However, more work is needed to fully elucidate the interactions between these factors and their potential in vivo importance.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS: Ultrastructural analysis, that is, electron microscopy, particularly immunogold labeling, will enable direct visualization of subcellular compartments. This in conjunction with the analysis of tissues lacking specific Rho GTPases, and Nox components will facilitate a detailed examination of the interactions of these structures with the actin cytoskeleton. In combination with the analysis of ROS production, including its subcellular location, these data will contribute significantly to our understanding of this intricate network under physiological conditions. Based on this, in vivo and in vitro studies can then be combined to elucidate the signaling pathways involved and their targets.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) stimulates tumor cell-cell interactions, matrix adhesion, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis. This factor is produced as an inactive precursor called pro-HGF, which requires proteolytic conversion, by HGF activator (HGFA) and matriptase, to evoke a biological response. Two new HGFA inhibitors, HAI-1 and HAI-2, inhibit the generation of biologically active HGF, through their interaction with HGFA. This study determined the expression of this HGF regulatory system in breast cancer. We examined HGF, the HGF receptor (c-Met), HGFA, matriptase, and the activation inhibitors (HAI-1 and HAI-2), tissues from patients with breast cancer.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Breast cancer tissue (n = 100) and normal background tissue (n = 20) was obtained immediately after surgery. The median follow-up for the patients was 72 months. HGF, c-Met, HGFA, matriptase-1, HAI-1, and HAI-2 expression was quantified using real-time quantitative PCR. The distribution of these factors in mammary tissues was also examined through immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: The breast cancer specimens expressed a significantly higher level of HGF, c-Met, HGFA, HAI-1, and HAI-2, but not matriptase, compared with the normal background tissues. Tumor tissues from node-positive patients expressed a higher level of HGFA than from the patients without nodal involvement. Interestingly, HAI-2 was expressed to a lower degree in positive nodes than that of the node-negative breast cancer tissues. HAI-1 and HAI-2 were both significantly reduced in grade 3 tumors compared with the well-differentiated tumors. In addition, on comparison of Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) classification groups, HAI-2 was also found to be statistically lower in the TNM 3 breast cancer group when compared with TNM groups 1 and 2, thus associated with a poor prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that there are aberrant levels of HGF, c-Met, HGFA, HAI-1, and HAI-2 expressed in breast cancer tissues compared with background breast tissue. HAI-1 and HAI-2 are expressed to a significantly lower level in poorly differentiated breast tumors, and HAI-2 is also inversely correlated with nodal involvement and tumor spread. Overall a low level of HAI-2 in the breast cancer tissues was associated with an overall poor outlook. Therefore, the HGF regulatory system may have an important role in the progression of breast cancer.},

	abstract = {Increased levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are associated with a poor response of breast cancer to anti-hormone treatment. Although VEGF is regarded as an endothelial-specific growth factor, recent reports have shown that VEGF can promote proliferation of other cell types, including breast tumor cells. We have characterized the proliferative effects of VEGF in breast cancer cell lines that are commonly used for understanding the role of estrogens, progestins, and anti-hormones on tumor growth. Since steroid hormones can increase the level of VEGF in certain breast cancer cells, we evaluated the effects of exogenous VEGF on the growth-suppressive effects of anti-estrogen (ICI 182,780) and RU-486 (anti-progestin mifepristone) in human breast cancer cells. VEGF165 and VEGF121 increased the proliferation of tumor cell lines that expressed VEGFR-2 (VEGF receptor 2) (flk/kdr) via the extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) pathway. Furthermore, VEGF induced the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and blocked down-regulation of Bcl-2 by ICI 182,780 and induced Bcl-2 in BT-474 and T47-D cells even in the presence of RU-486. Increased Bcl-2 levels in response to VEGF were associated with increased proliferation and survival of tumor cells even in the presence of anti-hormones. These results suggest that VEGF stimulates proliferation of VEGFR2-positive tumor cells, promotes survival via the expression and activity of Bcl-2 and overrides the growth-suppressive effects of anti-hormones. This represents a potential explanation for anti-hormone resistance and tumor progression in clinical samples. Thus, it may be useful to use combined modality treatment involving anti-hormones and anti-angiogenic agents to treat breast cancers that express elevated levels of VEGF.},

	issn = {1940-087X},
	doi = {10.3791/4152},
	abstract = {The interactions between cells and their surrounding microenvironment have functional consequences for cellular behaviour. On the single cell level, distinct microenvironments can impose differentiation, migration, and proliferation phenotypes, and on the tissue level the microenvironment processes as complex as morphogenesis and tumorigenesis(1). Not only do the cell and molecular contents of microenvironments impact the cells within, but so do the elasticity(2) and geometry(3) of the tissue. Defined as the sum total of cell-cell, -ECM, and -soluble factor interactions, in addition to physical characteristics, the microenvironment is complex. The phenotypes of cells within a tissue are partially due to their genomic content and partially due to the combinatorial interactions with the microenviroment. A major challenge is to link specific combinations of microenvironmental components with distinctive behaviours. Here, we present the microenvironment microarray (MEArray) platform for cell-based functional screening of interactions with combinatorial microenvironments(4). The method allows for simultaneous control of the molecular composition and the elastic modulus, and combines the use of widely available microarray and micropatterning technologies. MEArray screens require as few as 10,000 cells per array, which facilitates functional studies of rare cell types such as adult progenitor cells. A limitation of the technology is that entire tissue microenvironments cannot be completely recapitulated on MEArrays. However, comparison of responses in the same cell type to numerous related microenvironments, for instance pairwise combinations of ECM proteins that characterize a given tissue, will provide insights into how microenvironmental components elicit tissue-specific functional phenotypes. MEArrays can be printed using a wide variety of recombinant growth factors, cytokines, and purified ECM proteins, and combinations thereof. The platform is limited only by the availability of specific reagents. MEArrays are amenable to time-lapsed analysis, but most often are used for end point analyses of cellular functions that are measureable with fluorescent probes. For instance, DNA synthesis, apoptosis, acquisition of differentiated states, or production of specific gene products are commonly measured. Briefly, the basic flow of an MEArray experiment is to prepare slides coated with printing substrata and to prepare the master plate of proteins that are to be printed. Then the arrays are printed with a microarray robot, cells are allowed to attach, grow in culture, and then are chemically fixed upon reaching the experimental endpoint. Fluorescent or colorimetric assays, imaged with traditional microscopes or microarray scanners, are used to reveal relevant molecular and cellular phenotypes (Figure 1).},

	abstract = {Purpose The biology of tumors relapsing to bone is poorly understood. In this study, we initiated a search for genes that are implicated in tumors relapsing to bone in breast cancer.   Patients and Methods We analyzed 107 primary breast tumors in patients who were all lymph node negative at the time of diagnosis and all had experienced relapse. Total RNA isolated from frozen tumor samples was used to gather gene expression data using oligo microarrays.   Results A panel of 69 genes was found significantly differentially expressed between patients who experienced relapse to bone versus those who experienced relapse elsewhere in the body. The most differentially expressed gene, TFF1, was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in an independent cohort (n = 122; P = .0015). Our differentially expressed genes, combined with a recently reported gene set relevant to tumors relapsing to bone in an animal model system, pointed to the involvement of the fibroblast growth factor receptor signaling pathway in preference of tumor cells that relapse to bone. Given that patients who experience relapse to bone may benefit from bisphosphonate therapy, we developed a classifier of 31 genes, which in an independent validation set correctly predicts all tumors relapsing to bone with a specificity of 50\%.   Conclusion Our study identifies a panel of genes relevant to bone metastasis in breast cancer. The subsequently developed classifier of tumors relapsing to bone could, after thorough confirmation on an extended number of independent samples, and in combination with our previously developed high-risk profile, provide a diagnostic tool for the recommendation of adjuvant bisphosphonate therapy in addition to endocrine therapy or chemotherapy.},

Application of our method to high-depth sequencing data from breast, gastric, blood, colon and lung cancer samples, as well as metastatic deposits, showed that detectable subclones under selection, when present, consistently emerged early during tumor growth and had a large fitness advantage ({\textgreater}20\%).

High-grade glioma-derived cultures showed a range of glucose consumption between 1 and 5 nmol/min/mg protein. Normal astrocyte cultures and cultures derived from grades I-III gliomas had a glucose consumption rate of 2-3 nmol/min/mg protein. Seven high-grade glioma lines were derived from surgical samples taken from patients who had been scanned by 18F-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron computed tomography. The rate of glucose consumption in these high-grade glioma-derived lines was close to the maximum local cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (LCMRglc) measured in situ in the tumors from which the cultures were derived. In cultured glioma-derived lines, approximately one-half of the glucose consumed was recovered as lactate and pyruvate, suggesting a reliance of glioma cells on aerobic glycolysis. ATP and phosphocreatine (PCr) levels were variable in the glioma-derived lines, and ATP was lower in the glioma-derived lines than in the normal astrocytes. Levels and regulation of glycogen differed significantly among the various glioma-derived cell lines. Glycogen content did not diminish as glucose was consumed, suggesting that glycogen utilization is not tightly regulated by the glucose metabolic rate. These results suggest that human glioma-derived cell cultures (1) adequately reflect the metabolic capacity of gliomas in situ and (2) are significantly altered in several aspects of their glycolytic metabolism.},

	issn = {1752-0509},
	doi = {10.1186/s12918-017-0413-5},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Directed cell migration can be driven by a range of external stimuli, such as spatial gradients of: chemical signals (chemotaxis); adhesion sites (haptotaxis); or temperature (thermotaxis). Continuum models of cell migration typically include a diffusion term to capture the undirected component of cell motility and an advection term to capture the directed component of cell motility. However, there is no consensus in the literature about the form that the advection term takes. Some theoretical studies suggest that the advection term ought to include receptor saturation effects. However, others adopt a much simpler constant coefficient. One of the limitations of including receptor saturation effects is that it introduces several additional unknown parameters into the model. Therefore, a relevant research question is to investigate whether directed cell migration is best described by a simple constant tactic coefficient or a more complicated model incorporating saturation effects.
RESULTS: We study directed cell migration using an experimental device in which the directed component of the cell motility is driven by a spatial gradient of electric potential, which is known as electrotaxis. The electric field (EF) is proportional to the spatial gradient of the electric potential. The spatial variation of electric potential across the experimental device varies in such a way that there are several subregions on the device in which the EF takes on different values that are approximately constant within those subregions. We use cell trajectory data to quantify the motion of 3T3 fibroblast cells at different locations on the device to examine how different values of the EF influences cell motility. The undirected (random) motility of the cells is quantified in terms of the cell diffusivity, D, and the directed motility is quantified in terms of a cell drift velocity, v. Estimates D and v are obtained under a range of four different EF conditions, which correspond to normal physiological conditions. Our results suggest that there is no anisotropy in D, and that D appears to be approximately independent of the EF and the electric potential. The drift velocity increases approximately linearly with the EF, suggesting that the simplest linear advection term, with no additional saturation parameters, provides a good explanation of these physiologically relevant data.
CONCLUSIONS: We find that the simplest linear advection term in a continuum model of directed cell motility is sufficient to describe a range of different electrotaxis experiments for 3T3 fibroblast cells subject to normal physiological values of the electric field. This is useful information because alternative models that include saturation effects involve additional parameters that need to be estimated before a partial differential equation model can be applied to interpret or predict a cell migration experiment.},

Random cell migration refers to the intrinsic ability of cells to migrate, often called cell motility. This basal condition contrasts with directed cell migration, where cells migrate toward a chemical or physical cue. Unlike Brownian particles, however, randomly migrating cells exhibit a directional persistence, i.e., they are more likely to sustain the movement in the direction they previously took than to change, even if this direction is randomly chosen in an isotropic environment. Here we describe how to set up time-lapse recording of mammalian cells freely moving on a two-dimensional surface coated with extracellular matrix proteins, how to acquire single cell trajectories from movies and how to extract key parameters that characterize cell motility, such as cell speed, directionality, mean square displacement, and directional persistence.},

The variability of WGD across cancer types can be explained in part by cancer cell proliferation rates. WGD predicted for increased risk of death in tumors pan-cancer, a negative impact independent of established clinical prognostic factors in multiple cancer types including KRAS-mutant colorectal cancers and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers. WGD is one of the most common genomic events in cancer and is a macro-evolutionary event associated with poor prognosis across cancer types.},

Chromothripsis and whole genome duplication (WGD) have been recently identified in cancer. In the present study, we analyzed SCNA and determine the ploidy pattern in 123 IDH-wild-type glioblastomas, using SNP array data. WGD and chromothripsis events were validated using, respectively, FISH and CTLPScanner. WGD was detected in 11.4\% glioblastomas (14/123) and was associated with TP53 mutation (p = 0.0068). It was an early event occurring after the recurrent SCNA observed in diffuse high-grade gliomas. Glioblastomas with WGD were more aneuploid compared to glioblastomas without WGD (p {\textless} 0.0001). Chromothripsis occurred in 29.3\% glioblastomas (36/123) and mostly affected chromosomes 7, 9 and 12, with amplification of oncogenes (EGFR, MDM2/CDK4), and homozygous deletion of tumor suppressor genes (CDKN2A). There was a significant association between chromothripsis and gene rearrangement at a given locus. WGD is an early genetic event significantly associated to TP53 mutation and leading to chromosome instability and aneuploidy in IDH-wild-type glioblastoma. Chromothripsis recurrently targets oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes that are key players in gliomagenesis and tumor progression. The occurrence of chromothripsis points to underlying gene rearrangements (including gene fusions), potential therapeutic targets in glioblastoma.},

The oncogene-driven cells proliferated 1.7 times faster and showed a 1.5-fold increase in cell volume. The two phenotypes could be converted into each other 24 h after altering growth factor signalling. The large cells had a higher rate of protein synthesis, together with a shortened G1 phase. Additional experiments with chicken erythroblasts and mouse fibroblasts, synchronized by centrifugal elutriation, provided further evidence that vertebrate cells can respond to cell size alterations (induced either through different growth factor signalling or DNA synthesis inhibitors) by compensatory shortening of the subsequent G1 phase. Taken together, these data suggest that an active size threshold mechanism exists in G1, which induces adjustment of cell-cycle length in the next cycle, thus ensuring maintenance of a proper balance between growth and proliferation rates in vertebrates.},

Their characterization revealed that aneuploid strains share a number of phenotypes, including defects in cell cycle progression, increased glucose uptake, and increased sensitivity to conditions interfering with protein synthesis and protein folding. These phenotypes were observed only in strains carrying additional yeast genes, which indicates that they reflect the consequences of additional protein production as well as the resulting imbalances in cellular protein composition.

In this perspective, we advocate for the hypothesis that tumor cells with significantly elevated genomic content (polyploid tumor cells) facilitate rapid tumor evolution and the acquisition of therapy resistance in multiple incurable cancers. We appeal to studies conducted in yeast, cancer models, and cancer patients, which all converge on the hypothesis that polyploidy enables large phenotypic leaps, providing access to many different therapy-resistant phenotypes. We develop a flow-cytometry based method for quantifying the prevalence of polyploid tumor cells, and show the frequency of these cells in patient tumors may be higher than is generally appreciated. We then present recent studies identifying promising new therapeutic strategies that could be used to specifically target polyploid tumor cells in cancer patients. We argue that these therapeutic approaches should be incorporated into new treatment strategies aimed at blocking tumor evolution by killing the highly evolvable, therapy-resistant polyploid cell subpopulations, thus helping to maintain patient tumors in a drug sensitive state.},

The treatment of recurrent glioblastoma continues to be a moving target as new therapeutic principles enrich the standards of care for newly diagnosed disease. We reviewed PubMed and American Society of Clinical Oncology abstracts from January 2006 to January 2012 to identify clinical trials investigating the treatment of recurrent or progressive glioblastoma with nitrosoureas, temozolomide, bevacizumab, and/or combinations of these agents. At recurrence, a minority of patients are eligible for second surgery or reirradiation, based on appropriate patient selection. In temozolomide-pretreated patients, progression-free survival rates at 6 months of 20\%-30\% may be achieved either with nitrosoureas, temozolomide in various dosing regimens, or bevacizumab. Combination regimens among these agents or with other drugs have not produced evidence for superior activity but commonly produce more toxicity. More research is needed to better define patient profiles that predict benefit from the limited therapeutic options available after the current standard of care has failed.},

The aim of this review is to demonstrate the similarity between experimental oxygen debt in animals and human hemorrhage/post-traumatic conditions, and to examine metabolic oxygen debt correlates, namely base deficit and lactate, as indices of shock severity and adequacy of volume resuscitation. Relevant studies in the medical literature were identified using Medline and Cochrane Library searches. Findings in both experimental animals (dog/pig) and humans suggest that oxygen debt or its metabolic correlates may be more useful quantifiers of hemorrhagic shock than estimates of blood loss, volume replacement, blood pressure, or heart rate. This is evidenced by the oxygen debt/probability of death curves for the animals, and by the consistency of lethal dose (LD)25,50 points for base deficit across all three species. Quantifying human post-traumatic shock based on base deficit and adjusting for Glasgow Coma Scale score, prothrombin time, Injury Severity Score and age is demonstrated to be superior to anatomic injury severity alone or in combination with Trauma and Injury Severity Score. The data examined in this review indicate that estimates of oxygen debt and its metabolic correlates should be included in studies of experimental shock and in the management of patients suffering from hemorrhagic shock.},

	abstract = {The discovery of oxygen is considered by some to be the most important scientific discovery of all time – from both physical-chemical/astrophysics and biology/evolution viewpoints. One of the major developments during evolution is the ability to capture dioxygen in the environment and deliver it to each cell in the multicellular, complex mammalian body -- on demand, i.e. just-intime. Humans use oxygen to extract approximately 2550 Calories (10.4 MJ) from food to meet daily energy requirements. This combustion requires about 22 moles of dioxygen per day, or 2.5 × 10-4 mol s-1. This is an average rate of oxygen utilization of 2.5 × 10-18 mol cell-1 s-1, i.e. 2.5 amol cell-1 s-1. Cells have a wide range of oxygen utilization, depending on cell type, function, and biological status. Measured rates of oxygen utilization by mammalian cells in culture range from {\textless}1 to {\textgreater}350 amol cell-1 s-1. There is a loose positive linear correlation of the rate of oxygen consumption (OCR) by mammalian cells in culture with cell volume and cell protein. The use of oxygen by cells and tissues is an essential aspect of the basic redox biology of cells and tissues. This type of quantitative information is fundamental to investigations in quantitative redox biology, especially redox systems biology.},

This work establishes the reproducibility of perfusion measurements using the noninvasive MRI technique of continuous arterial spin labeling (CASL). Perfusion was measured in 34 healthy normal subjects. Intersubject variability was assessed, and age and gender contributions were estimated. Intersubject variation was found to be large, with up to 100\% perfusion difference for subjects of the same age and gender. Repeated measurements in one subject showed that perfusion remains remarkably stable in the short term when compared with intersubject variation and the large capacity for perfusion change in the brain. A significant decrease in the ratio of gray-matter to white-matter perfusion was found with increasing age (0.79\% per year (P {\textless} 0.0005)). This appears to be due mainly to a reduction in gray-matter perfusion, which was found to decrease by 0.45\% per year (P = 0.04). Regional analysis suggested that the gray-matter age-related changes were predominantly localized in the frontal cortex. Whole-brain perfusion was 13\% higher (P = 0.02) in females compared to males.},

	issn = {1028-768X},
	abstract = {The human brain is nearly 60 percent fat. We've learned in recent years that fatty acids are among the most crucial molecules that determine your brain's integrity and ability to perform. Essential fatty acids (EFAs) are required for maintenance of optimal health but they can not synthesized by the body and must be obtained from dietary sources. Clinical observation studies has related imbalance dietary intake of fatty acids to impaired brain performance and diseases. Most of the brain growth is completed by 5-6 years of age. The EFAs, particularly the omega-3 fatty acids, are important for brain development during both the fetal and postnatal period. Dietary decosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is needed for the optimum functional maturation of the retina and visual cortex, with visual acuity and mental development seemingly improved by extra DHA. Beyond their important role in building the brain structure, EFAs, as messengers, are involved in the synthesis and functions of brain neurotransmitters, and in the molecules of the immune system. Neuronal membranes contain phospholipid pools that are the reservoirs for the synthesis of specific lipid messengers on neuronal stimulation or injury. These messengers in turn participate in signaling cascades that can either promote neuronal injury or neuroprotection. The goal of this review is to give a new understanding of how EFAs determine our brain's integrity and performance, and to recall the neuropsychiatric disorders that may be influenced by them. As we further unlock the mystery of how fatty acids affect the brain and better understand the brain's critical dependence on specific EFAs, correct intake of the appropriate diet or supplements becomes one of the tasks we undertake in pursuit of optimal wellness.},

The haemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve, a graphical representation of the relationship between oxygen satur-ation and oxygen partial pressure helps us to understand some of the principles underpinning this process. Historically this curve was derived from very limited data based on blood samples from small numbers of healthy subjects which were manipulated in vitro and ultimately determined by equations such as those described by Severinghaus in 1979. In a study of 3524 clinical specimens, we found that this equation estimated the S O2 in blood from patients with normal pH and S O2 {\textgreater}70\% with remarkable accuracy and, to our knowledge, this is the first large-scale validation of this equation using clinical samples. Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (S pO2 ) is nowadays the standard clinical method for assessing arterial oxygen saturation, providing a convenient, pain-free means of continuously assessing oxygenation, provided the interpreting clinician is aware of important limitations. The use of pulse oximetry reduces the need for arterial blood gas analysis (S aO2 ) as many patients who are not at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure or metabolic acidosis and have acceptable S pO2 do not necessarily require blood gas analysis. While arterial sampling remains the gold-standard method of assessing ventilation and oxygenation, in those patients in whom blood gas analysis is indicated, arterialised capillary samples also have a valuable role in patient care. The clinical role of venous blood gases however remains less well defined.},

	abstract = {Many cancers have long been thought to primarily metabolize glucose for energy production—a phenomenon known as the Warburg Effect, after the classic studies of Otto Warburg in the early twentieth century. Yet cancer cells also utilize other substrates, such as amino acids and fatty acids, to produce raw materials for cellular maintenance and energetic currency to accomplish cellular tasks. The contribution of these substrates is increasingly appreciated in the context of glioma, the most common form of malignant brain tumor. Multiple catabolic pathways are used for energy production within glioma cells, and are linked in many ways to anabolic pathways supporting cellular function. For example: glycolysis both supports energy production and provides carbon skeletons for the synthesis of nucleic acids; meanwhile fatty acids are used both as energetic substrates and as raw materials for lipid membranes. Furthermore, bio-energetic pathways are connected to pro-oncogenic signaling within glioma cells. For example: AMPK signaling links catabolism with cell cycle progression; mTOR signaling contributes to metabolic flexibility and cancer cell survival; the electron transport chain produces ATP and reactive oxygen species (ROS) which act as signaling molecules; Hypoxia Inducible Factors (HIFs) mediate interactions with cells and vasculature within the tumor environment. Mutations in the tumor suppressor p53, and the tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1 and 2 have been implicated in oncogenic signaling as well as establishing metabolic phenotypes in genetically-defined subsets of malignant glioma. These pathways critically contribute to tumor biology. The aim of this review is two-fold. Firstly, we present the current state of knowledge regarding the metabolic strategies employed by malignant glioma cells, including aerobic glycolysis; the pentose phosphate pathway; one-carbon metabolism; the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which is central to amino acid metabolism; oxidative phosphorylation; and fatty acid metabolism, which significantly contributes to energy production in glioma cells. Secondly, we highlight processes (including the Randle Effect, AMPK signaling, mTOR activation, etc.) which are understood to link bio-energetic pathways with oncogenic signals, thereby allowing the glioma cell to achieve a pro-malignant state.},

This study provides fresh insights into the selection of glioblastoma patients most likely to benefit from antiangiogenic treatments., Antiangiogenic therapy has shown clear activity and improved survival benefit for certain tumor types. However, an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms of action of antiangiogenic agents has hindered optimization and broader application of this new therapeutic modality. In particular, the impact of antiangiogenic therapy on tumor blood flow and oxygenation status (i.e., the role of vessel pruning versus normalization) remains controversial. This controversy has become critical as multiple phase III trials of anti-VEGF agents combined with cytotoxics failed to show overall survival benefit in newly diagnosed glioblastoma (nGBM) patients and several other cancers. Here, we shed light on mechanisms of nGBM response to cediranib, a pan-VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, using MRI techniques and blood biomarkers in prospective phase II clinical trials of cediranib with chemoradiation vs. chemoradiation alone in nGBM patients. We demonstrate that improved perfusion occurs only in a subset of patients in cediranib-containing regimens, and is associated with improved overall survival in these nGBM patients. Moreover, an increase in perfusion is associated with improved tumor oxygenation status as well as with pharmacodynamic biomarkers, such as changes in plasma placenta growth factor and sVEGFR2. Finally, treatment resistance was associated with elevated plasma IL-8 and sVEGFR1 posttherapy. In conclusion, tumor perfusion changes after antiangiogenic therapy may distinguish responders vs. nonresponders early in the course of this expensive and potentially toxic form of therapy, and these results may provide new insight into the selection of glioblastoma patients most likely to benefit from anti-VEGF treatments.},

Here, we draw attention to three particular problems: (1) ATP generation linked to β-oxidation of fatty acids demands more oxygen than glucose, thereby enhancing the risk for neurons to become hypoxic; (2) β-oxidation of fatty acids generates superoxide, which, taken together with the poor anti-oxidative defense in neurons, causes severe oxidative stress; (3) the rate of ATP generation based on adipose tissue-derived fatty acids is slower than that using blood glucose as fuel. Thus, in periods of extended continuous and rapid neuronal firing, fatty acid oxidation cannot guarantee rapid ATP generation in neurons. We conjecture that the disadvantages connected with using fatty acids as fuel have created evolutionary pressure on lowering the expression of the β-oxidation enzyme equipment in brain mitochondria to avoid extensive fatty acid oxidation and to favor glucose oxidation in brain.},

One could give up the detection of subpopulations and directly estimate the differentiation process from cell profiles. A combination of both types of information, however, is preferable. Crucially, clusters can serve as anchor points of differentiation trajectories. Here we present GraphDDP, which integrates both viewpoints in an intuitive visualization. GraphDDP starts from a user-defined cluster assignment and then uses a force-based graph layout approach on two types of carefully constructed edges: one emphasizing cluster membership, the other, based on density gradients, emphasizing differentiation trajectories. We show on intestinal epithelial cells and myeloid progenitor data that GraphDDP allows the identification of differentiation pathways that cannot be easily detected by other approaches.},

The mechanistic definition of cell fitness is not understood, nor is it understood how fitness differences are recognized. Drosophila cells with extra Myc activity acquire "supercompetitor" status upon confrontation with wild-type (WT) cells, prompting the latter's elimination via apoptosis. Here we show that such confrontation enhances glycolytic flux in Myc cells and promotes their fitness and proliferation in a p53-dependent manner. Whereas p53 loss in noncompeting Myc cells is inconsequential, its loss impairs metabolism, reduces viability, and prevents the killing activity of Myc supercompetitor cells. We propose that p53 acts as a general sensor of competitive confrontation to enhance the fitness of the "winner" population. Our findings suggest that the initial confrontation between precancerous and WT cells could enhance cancer cell fitness and promote tumor progression.},

	abstract = {Scratch assays are routinely used to study collective cell behaviour in vitro. Typical experimental protocols do not vary the initial density of cells, and typical mathematical modelling approaches describe cell motility and proliferation based on assumptions of linear diffusion and logistic growth. Jin et al. (2016) ﬁnd that the behaviour of cells in scratch assays is density dependent, and showed that standard modelling approaches cannot simultaneously describe data initiated across a range of initial densities. To address this limitation, we calibrate an individual based model to scratch assay data across a large range of initial densities. Our model allows proliferation, motility and a direction bias to depend on interactions between neighbouring cells. By considering a hierarchy of models where we sequentially remove interactions, we perform model selection analysis to identify the minimum interactions required for the model to simultaneously describe data across all initial densities. The calibrated model is able to match the experimental data across all densities and captures details about the spatial structure of cells. Our primary ﬁndings provide strong evidence to suggest that motility is density-dependent in these experiments. On the other hand, we do not see the effect of crowding on proliferation in these experiments. These results are signiﬁcant as they are precisely the opposite of the assumptions in standard continuum models, such as the Fisher-Kolmogorov equation and generalisations of the Fisher-Kolmogorov equation.},

The method is suited to complex problems that arise in population genetics, extending ideas developed in this setting by earlier authors. Properties of the posterior distribution of a parameter, such as its mean or density curve, are approximated without explicit likelihood calculations. This is achieved by fitting a local-linear regression of simulated parameter values on simulated summary statistics, and then substituting the observed summary statistics into the regression equation. The method combines many of the advantages of Bayesian statistical inference with the computational efficiency of methods based on summary statistics. A key advantage of the method is that the nuisance parameters are automatically integrated out in the simulation step, so that the large numbers of nuisance parameters that arise in population genetics problems can be handled without difficulty. Simulation results indicate computational and statistical efficiency that compares favorably with those of alternative methods previously proposed in the literature. We also compare the relative efficiency of inferences obtained using methods based on summary statistics with those obtained directly from the data using MCMC.},

Using various inhibitors of mitochondrial electron transport we have investigated the mechanism of TNF-mediated cytotoxicity in L929 and WEHI 164 clone 13 mouse fibrosarcoma cells. Inhibitors with different sites of action modulated TNF cytotoxicity, however, with contrasting effects on final cell viability. Inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport at complex III (cytochrome c reductase) by antimycin A resulted in a marked potentiation of TNF-mediated injury. In contrast, when the electron flow to ubiquinone was blocked, either at complex I (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase) with amytal or at complex II (succinate-ubiquinone reductase) with thenoyltrifluoroacetone, cells were markedly protected against TNF cytotoxicity. Neither uncouplers nor inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation nor complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase) inhibitors significantly interfered with TNF-mediated effects, ruling out the involvement of energy-coupled phenomena. In addition, the toxic effects of TNF were counteracted by the addition of antioxidants and iron chelators. Furthermore, we analyzed the direct effect of TNF on mitochondrial morphology and functions. Treatment of L929 cells with TNF led to an early degeneration of the mitochondrial ultrastructure without any pronounced damage of other cellular organelles. Analysis of the mitochondrial electron flow revealed that TNF treatment led to a rapid inhibition of the mitochondria to oxidize succinate and NADH-linked substrates. The inhibition of electron transport was dose-dependent and became readily detectable 60 min after the start of TNF treatment, thus preceding the onset of cell death by at least 3-6 h. In contrast, only minor effects were observed on complex IV activity. The different effects observed with the mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitors provide suggestive evidence that mitochondrial production of oxygen radicals mainly generated at the ubisemiquinone site is a causal mechanism of TNF cytotoxicity. This conclusion is further supported by the protective effect of antioxidants as well as the selective pattern of damage of mitochondrial chain components and characteristic alterations of the mitochondrial ultrastructure.},

TNFR1 signaling is also known to activate the transcription factor NF-kappa B and promote survival. The mechanism by which this decision between cell death and survival is arbitrated is not clear. We report that TNFR1-induced apoptosis involves two sequential signaling complexes. The initial plasma membrane bound complex (complex I) consists of TNFR1, the adaptor TRADD, the kinase RIP1, and TRAF2 and rapidly signals activation of NF-kappa B. In a second step, TRADD and RIP1 associate with FADD and caspase-8, forming a cytoplasmic complex (complex II). When NF-kappa B is activated by complex I, complex II harbors the caspase-8 inhibitor FLIP(L) and the cell survives. Thus, TNFR1-mediated-signal transduction includes a checkpoint, resulting in cell death (via complex II) in instances where the initial signal (via complex I, NF-kappa B) fails to be activated.},

We show that the expression of subsets of the 432 genes is enriched in the immune and nervous systems, and cellular sensitivity to necroptosis is regulated by an extensive signaling network mediating innate immunity.

This Fas ligand–induced caspase-independent death is absent in T cells that are deficient in either Fas-associated death domain (FADD) or receptor-interacting protein (RIP). RIP is also required for necrotic death induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). In contrast to its role in nuclear factor κB activation, RIP requires its own kinase activity for death signaling. Thus, Fas, TRAIL and TNF receptors can initiate cell death by two alternative pathways, one relying on caspase-8 and the other dependent on the kinase RIP.},

This new algorithm incorporates well-known Bayesian techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the ABC approach for estimation of hierarchical models. We then use the Gibbs ABC algorithm to estimate the parameters of two models of signal detection, one with and one without a tractable likelihood function.},

In the past decades, much efforts have been invested to identify better biomarkers for predicting prognoses. Recently, necroptosis has been reported as a specialized pathway of programmed necrosis. Moreover, regulators of necroptosis-pathway-associated genes ( RIPK1, RIPK3  and  MLKL ) were reported to be related to prognoses of many types of tumors. However, the prognostic value of these genes in diffuse glioma including low-grade glioma (LGG) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains unknown. 
 Methods:  An online tool-Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) (http://gepia.cancer-pku.cn/) was used to analyze different expression of necroptosis-pathway-associated genes between tumor and normal tissue, correlation between  RIPK1, RIPK3  and  MLKL , the relationship between necroptosis-pathway-associated genes and prognosis [overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS)] in LGG and GBM. The median expression of  RIPK1, RIPK3  and  MLKL  was used to divide patients into high- versus low-expression group. All graphic presentations were drawn by Gepia database.
 Results:  Expression of  RIPK1  and  RIPK3  were significantly higher in tumor tissue of GBM as compared with normal tissue. A moderate correlation between  MLKL  and  RIPK3  was demonstrated in both LGG (R =0.79) and GBM (R =0.79). In LGG, higher expression of RIPK1, RIPK3, and  MLKL  were associated with poor OS and DFS with HR values of 2.2, 2, 1.9 for OS and 1.7, 1.8, 1.6 for DFS, respectively. In GBM, only a higher expression of  MLKL  was associated with worse OS and DFS with HR values of 1.5 and 1.6, respectively. 
 Conclusions:  Regulators of necroptosis-pathway-associated genes appear to have a potential to serve as biomarkers of prognosis in both LGG and GBM.},

	abstract = {Mistakes during cell division frequently generate changes in chromosome content, producing aneuploid or polyploid progeny cells. Polyploid cells may then undergo abnormal division to generate aneuploid cells. Chromosome segregation errors may also involve fragments of whole chromosomes. A major consequence of segregation defects is change in the relative dosage of products from genes located on the missegregated chromosomes. Abnormal expression of transcriptional regulators can also impact genes on the properly segregated chromosomes. The consequences of these perturbations in gene expression depend on the specific chromosomes affected and on the interplay of the aneuploid phenotype with the environment. Most often, these novel chromosome distributions are detrimental to the health and survival of the organism. However, in a changed environment, alterations in gene copy number may generate a more highly adapted phenotype. Chromosome segregation errors also have important implications in human health. They may promote drug resistance in pathogenic microorganisms. In cancer cells, they are a source for genetic and phenotypic variability that may select for populations with increased malignance and resistance to therapy. Lastly, chromosome segregation errors during gamete formation in meiosis are a primary cause of human birth defects and infertility. This review describes the consequences of mitotic and meiotic errors focusing on novel concepts and human health.},

	doi = {10.1017/s0016672300004821},
	abstract = {The yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was used as a model to investigate theories of ploidy evolution. Mutagenesis experiments using the alkylating agent EMS (ethane methyl sulphonate) were conducted to assess the relative importance that masking of deleterious mutations has on response to and recovery from DNA damage. In particular, we tested whether cells with higher ploidy levels have relatively higher fitnesses after mutagenesis, whether the advantages of masking are more pronounced in tetraploids than in diploids, and whether purging of mutations allows more rapid recovery of haploid cells than cells with higher ploidy levels. Separate experiments were performed on asexually propagating stationary phase cells using (1) prototrophic haploid (MAT alpha) and diploid (MATa/alpha) strains and (2) isogenic haploid, diploid and tetraploid strains lacking a functional mating type locus. In both sets of experiments, haploids showed a more pronounced decrease in apparent growth rate than diploids, but both haploids and diploids appeared to recover very rapidly. Tetraploids did not show increased benefits of masking compared with diploids but volume measurements and FACScan analyses on the auxotrophic strains indicated that all treated tetraploid strains decreased in ploidy level and that some of the treated haploid lines increased in ploidy level. Results from these experiments confirm that while masking deleterious mutations provides an immediate advantage to higher ploidy levels in the presence of mutagens, selection is extremely efficient at removing induced mutations, leading growth rates to increase rapidly over time at all ploidy levels. Furthermore, ploidy level is itself a mutable trait in the presence of EMS, with both haploids and tetraploids often evolving towards diploidy (the ancestral state of S. cerevisiae) during the course of the experiment.},

	abstract = {The exquisite sensitivity of mitotic cancer cells to ionizing radiation (IR) underlies an important rationale for the widely used fractionated radiation therapy. However, the mechanism for this cell cycle-dependent vulnerability is unknown. Here we show that treatment with IR leads to mitotic chromosome segregation errors in vivo and long-lasting aneuploidy in tumour-derived cell lines. These mitotic errors generate an abundance of micronuclei that predispose chromosomes to subsequent catastrophic pulverization thereby independently amplifying radiation-induced genome damage. Experimentally suppressing whole-chromosome missegregation reduces downstream chromosomal defects and significantly increases the viability of irradiated mitotic cells. Further, orthotopically transplanted human glioblastoma tumours in which chromosome missegregation rates have been reduced are rendered markedly more resistant to IR, exhibiting diminished markers of cell death in response to treatment. This work identifies a novel mitotic pathway for radiation-induced genome damage, which occurs outside of the primary nucleus and augments chromosomal breaks. This relationship between radiation treatment and whole-chromosome missegregation can be exploited to modulate therapeutic response in a clinically relevant manner.},

To better understand the signals triggering phagocytosis of apoptotic glioma cells, and to identify the cells that might be involved in the phagocytic process, U-251 MG glioma cells were made apoptotic by etoposide (25 microg/ml) treatment and were incubated with normal human astrocytes (NHA), glioma cells, or microglia. Extent of phagocytosis was assessed by an in vitro phagocytosis assay. After 3 h of incubation with apoptotic cells, phagocytes tested were washed to remove nonengulfed cells, then fixed, stained, and counted to determine phagocytosis index (PI). NHA, glioma cells, and microglia all phagocytosed apoptotic, but not nonapoptotic, glioma cells. Microglia, however, had a PI approximately 4-fold higher than did either NHA or glioma cells. Binding of phosphatidylserine (PS) on apoptotic glioma cell membranes by annexin-V inhibited phagocytosis by 90\% in both microglia and NHA. The activity of an enzyme (scramblase) that moves PS from the inner cell membrane to the outer cell membrane was also increased in apoptotic glioma cells. These results suggest that a variety of cells present in and near gliomas in vivo can remove glioma cells in a PS-dependent scramblase-mediated fashion. Manipulation of scramblase and/or PS exposure in glioma cells may therefore be a means of triggering phagocytic removal of glioma cells.},

To affect their fate, it is essential for cells to integrate signals from the environment. Recently, it has been recognized that physical forces such as stretch, strain, and tension play a critical role in regulating this process. Despite intensive investigation, the pathways by which mechanical signals are converted to biochemical responses is yet to be completely understood. In this review, we will examine our current understanding of how mechanical forces induce apoptosis in a variety of biological systems. Rather than being a degenerative event, physical forces act through specific receptor-like molecules such as integrins, focal adhesion proteins, and the cytoskeleton. These molecules in turn activate a limited number of protein kinase pathways (p38 MAPK and JNK/SAPK), which amplify the signal and activate enzymes (caspases) that promote apoptosis. Physical forces concurrently activate other signaling pathways such as PIK-3 and Erk 1/2 MAPK, which modulate the apoptotic response. The cell phenotype and the character of the physical stimuli determine which pathways are activated and, consequently, allow for variability in response to a specific stimulus in different cell types.},

Once activated, integrins establish a regulated link between the extracellular matrix and the cytoskeleton. Integrins have well-established functions in cancer, such as in controlling cell survival by engagement of many specific intracellular signaling pathways and in facilitating metastasis. Integrins and associated proteins are regulated by control of transcription, membrane traffic, and degradation, as well as by a number of post-translational modifications including glycosylation, allowing integrin function to be modulated to conform to various cellular needs and environmental conditions. In this review, we examine the control of integrin function by cell metabolism, and the impact of this regulation in cancer. Within this context, nutrient sufficiency or deprivation is sensed by a number of metabolic signaling pathways such as AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1, which collectively control integrin function by a number of mechanisms. Moreover, metabolic flux through specific pathways also controls integrins, such as by control of integrin glycosylation, thus impacting integrin-dependent cell adhesion and migration. Integrins also control various metabolic signals and pathways, establishing the reciprocity of this regulation. As cancer cells exhibit substantial changes in metabolism, such as a shift to aerobic glycolysis, enhanced glucose utilization and a heightened dependence on specific amino acids, the reciprocal regulation of integrins and metabolism may provide important clues for more effective treatment of various cancers.},

Here, we summarize new findings characterizing the impact of aneuploidy on protein quality control. Because aneuploidy has been associated with many diseases, foremost among them being cancer, and has also been linked to aging, we also offer our perspective on whether and how the effects of aneuploidy on protein quality control could contribute to these conditions. We argue that acquiring a deeper understanding of the relationship between aneuploidy, disease and aging could lead to the development of new anti-cancer and anti-aging treatments.},

	abstract = {A close relationship between cell death and pathological calcification has recently been reported, such as vascular calcification in atherosclerosis. However, the roles of cell death in calcification by osteoblast lineage have not been elucidated in detail. In this study, we investigated whether cell death is involved in the calcification on osteoblastic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) under osteogenic culture in vitro. Apoptosis and necrosis occurred in an osteogenic culture of hMSC, and cell death preceded calcification. The generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species, chromatin condensation and fragmentation, and caspase-3 activation increased in this culture. A pan-caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK) and anti-oxidants (Tiron and n-acetylcysteine) inhibited osteogenic culture-induced cell death and calcification. Furthermore, calcification was significantly promoted by the addition of necrotic dead cells or its membrane fraction. Spontaneously dead cells by osteogenic culture and exogenously added necrotic cells were surrounded by calcium deposits. Induction of localized cell death by photodynamic treatment in the osteogenic culture resulted in co-localized calcification. These findings show that necrotic and apoptotic cell deaths were induced in an osteogenic culture of hMSC and indicated that both necrotic and apoptotic cells of osteoblast lineage served as nuclei for calcification on osteoblastic differentiation of hMSC in vitro.},

	abstract = {SummaryEmodin, an anthraquinone compound extracted from rhubarb and other traditional Chinese medicines, has been proven to have a wide range of pharmacological effects, such as anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antitumor activities. Previous studies have confirmed that emodin has inhibitory effects on various solid tumors, such as osteosarcoma, liver cancer, prostate cancer and glioma. This study aimed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of emodin-induced necroptosis in the glioma cell line U251 by targeting the TNF-α/RIP1/RIP3 signaling pathway. We found that emodin could significantly inhibit U251 cell proliferation, and the viability of U251 cells treated with emodin was reduced in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Flow cytometry assays and Hoechst-PI staining assays showed that emodin induced apoptosis and necroptosis. Real-time PCR and western blot analysis showed that emodin upregulated the levels of TNF-α, RIP1, RIP3 and MLKL. Furthermore, the RIP1 inhibitor Nec-1 and the RIP3 inhibitor GSK872 attenuated the killing effect of emodin on U251 cells. In addition, emodin could increase the levels of TNF-α, RIP1, RIP3 and MLKL in vivo. The results demonstrate that emodin could induce necroptosis in glioma possibly through the activation of the TNF-α/RIP1/RIP3 axis. These studies provide novel insight into the induction of necroptosis by emodin and indicate that emodin might be a potential candidate for treating glioma through the necroptosis pathway.},

	abstract = {Follicular lymphoma (FL) is a low-grade B cell malignancy that transforms into a highly aggressive and lethal disease at a rate of 2\% per year. Perfect isolation of the malignant B cell population from a surgical biopsy is a significant challenge, masking important FL biology, such as immune checkpoint co-expression patterns. To resolve the underlying transcriptional networks of follicular B cell lymphomas we analyzed the transcriptomes of 34,188 cells derived from six primary FL tumors. For each tumor, we identified normal immune subpopulations and malignant B cells based on gene expression. We used multicolor flow cytometry analysis of the same tumors to confirm our assignments of cellular lineages and validate our predictions of expressed proteins. Comparison of gene expression between matched malignant and normal B cells from the same patient revealed tumor-specific features. Malignant B cells exhibited restricted immunoglobulin light chain expression (either Ig Kappa or Ig Lambda), as well the expected upregulation of the BCL2 gene, but also down-regulation of the FCER2, CD52 and MHC class II genes. By analyzing thousands of individual cells per patient tumor, we identified the mosaic of malignant B cell subclones that coexist within a FL and examined the characteristics of tumor-infiltrating T cells. We identified genes co-expressed with immune checkpoint molecules, such as CEBPA and B2M in Tregs, providing a better understanding of the gene networks involved in immune regulation. In summary, parallel measurement of single-cell expression in thousands of tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes can be used to obtain a systems-level view of the tumor microenvironment and identify new avenues for therapeutic development.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The effects of serum starvation on radiation sensitivity, cell proliferation and apoptosis were investigated with particular consideration of the p53 status.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four human tumor cell lines, Be11 (melanoma, p53 wild-type), MeWo (melanoma, p53 mutant), 4197 (squamous cell carcinoma, p53 wild-type) and 4451 (squamous cell carcinoma, p53 mutant), were used. After the cells had been incubated in starvation medium (0.5\% FCS) for 1-6 days, changes in cell cycle distribution, induction of apoptosis and necrosis, and changes in radiation sensitivity were assessed by two-parameter flow cytometric measurements of DNA-dye-exclusion/Annexin V binding, and a conventional colony assay, respectively.
RESULTS: p53 wild-type cell lines showed a decrease in the BrdU labeling index and an increase in the apoptotic cell frequency in starvation medium. p53 mutant cell lines showed a decrease in the BrdU labeling index but no evidence of apoptosis. These cells went into necrosis instead. The radiation sensitivity was increased in 4451 and slightly decreased in Be11 and 4197 in starvation medium.
CONCLUSION: These data suggest a functional involvement of p53 in starvation-induced G1-block and apoptosis in tumor cells. Altered radiosensitivity after culture in starvation medium seemed to be explained at least in part by the starvation-induced G1-block. The frequency of starvation-induced apoptosis or necrosis was not correlated with radiation sensitivity.},

However, it is unknown if these two GSC populations are sufficient to generate the spectrum of cellular heterogeneity observed in GBM. The lineage relationships and niche interactions of GSCs have not been fully elucidated. We perform single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and matched exome sequencing of human GBMs (12 patients; \&gt;37,000 cells) to identify recurrent hierarchies of GSCs and their progeny. We map sequenced cells to tumor-anatomical structures and identify microenvironment interactions using reference atlases and quantitative immunohistochemistry. We find that all GSCs can be described by a single axis of variation, ranging from proneural to mesenchymal. Increasing mesenchymal GSC (mGSC) content, but not proneural GSC (pGSC) content, correlates with significantly inferior survival. All clonal expressed mutations are found in the GSC populations, with a greater representation of mutations found in mGSCs. While pGSCs upregulate markers of cell-cycle progression, mGSCs are largely quiescent and overexpress cytokines mediating the chemotaxis of myeloid-derived suppressor cells. We find mGSCs enriched in hypoxic regions while pGSCs are enriched in the tumor’s invasive edge. We show that varying proportions of mGSCs, pGSCs, their progeny and stromal/immune cells are sufficient to explain the genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity observed in GBM. This study sheds light on a long-standing debate regarding the lineage relationships between GSCs and other glioma cell types.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Although chromosomal instability is a major driver of tumour evolution, its role in metastasis has not been established. Here we show that chromosomal instability promotes metastasis by sustaining a tumour cell-autonomous response to cytosolic DNA. Errors in chromosome segregation create a preponderance of micronuclei whose rupture spills genomic DNA into the cytosol. This leads to the activation of the cGAS–STING (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase–stimulator of interferon genes) cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway and downstream noncanonical NF-κB signalling. Genetic suppression of chromosomal instability markedly delays metastasis even in highly aneuploid tumour models, whereas continuous chromosome segregation errors promote cellular invasion and metastasis in a STING-dependent manner. By subverting lethal epithelial responses to cytosolic DNA, chromosomally unstable tumour cells co-opt chronic activation of innate immune pathways to spread to distant organs.},

For example, apoptotic cells can release factors that influence the proliferation and survival of adjacent tissues. Apoptosis can also affect tissue movement and morphogenesis by modifying tissue tension in surrounding cells. As we review here, these findings reveal unexpected roles for apoptosis in tissue remodeling during development, as well as in regeneration and cancer., Summary: This Review highlights how apoptotic cells impact the surrounding tissue to promote morphogenesis and remodelling through secreted signals during development, regeneration and cancer.},

In this study, we examined the biological significance of necrotic tissues by exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying the signaling network between necrotic tissues and GBM cells. The migration and invasion of the GBM cell line CRT-MG was significantly enhanced by treatment with necrotic cells, as shown by assays for scratch wound healing and spheroid invasion. Incubation with necrotic cells induced IL-8 secretion in CRT-MG cells in a dose-dependent manner. In human GBM tissues, IL-8 positive cells were mainly distributed in the perinecrotic region, as seen in immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analysis. Necrotic cells induced NF-κB and AP-1 activation and their binding to the IL-8 promoter, leading to enhanced IL-8 production and secretion in GBM cells. Our data demonstrate that when GBM cells are exposed to and stimulated by necrotic cells, the migration and invasion of GBM cells are enhanced and facilitated via NF-κB/AP-1 mediated IL-8 upregulation.},

This leads to the formation of waves of tumor cells actively migrating away from central hypoxia.

Our simulations reveal the formation of a traveling wave of tumor cells that reproduces the observed histologic patterns of pseudopalisades.

We herein investigated whether and how it might contribute to the survival of cancer cells that are in low-nutrient conditions during tumour growth, by culturing isogenic human colorectal cancer cell lines (HCT116) and breast cancer cell lines in a medium deprived in amino acids and serum. We show that such starvation enhances, independently from p53, the expression of p21 and that of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein Puma. Under these conditions, p21 prevents Puma and its downstream effector Bax from triggering the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. This anti-apoptotic effect is exerted from the cytosol but it is unrelated to the ability of p21 to interfere with the effector caspase 3. The survival function of p21 is, however, overcome by RNA interference mediated Bcl-xL depletion, or by the pharmacological inhibitor ABT-737. Thus, an insufficient supply in nutrients may not have an overt effect on cancer cell viability due to p21 induction, but it primes these cells to die, and sensitizes them to the deleterious effects of Bcl-xL inhibitors regardless of their p53 status.},

For this purpose, here we present the general experimental-computational framework SAPHIRE (Stochastic Annotation of Phenotypic Individual-cell Responses) to characterize phenotypic cellular responses from time series imaging datasets. Hidden Markov modeling is used to infer and annotate morphological state and state-switching properties from image-derived cell shape measurements. Time series modeling is performed on each cell individually, making the approach broadly useful for analyzing asynchronous cell populations. Two-color fluorescent cells simultaneously expressing actin and nuclear reporters enabled us to profile temporal changes in cell shape following pharmacological inhibition of cytoskeleton-regulatory signaling pathways. Results are compared with existing approaches conventionally applied to fixed-cell imaging datasets, and indicate that time series modeling captures heterogeneous dynamic cellular responses that can improve drug classification and offer additional important insight into mechanisms of drug action.

Here, we benchmark 45 of these methods on 110 real and 229 synthetic datasets for cellular ordering, topology, scalability and usability. Our results highlight the complementarity of existing tools, and that the choice of method should depend mostly on the dataset dimensions and trajectory topology. Based on these results, we develop a set of guidelines to help users select the best method for their dataset.

The relationships between TFs and their target genes can be modeled in terms of directed regulatory networks. These relationships, in turn, can be readily compared with commonplace “chain-of-command” structures in social networks, which have characteristic hierarchical layouts. Here, we develop algorithms for identifying generalized hierarchies (allowing for various loop structures) and use these approaches to illuminate extensive pyramid-shaped hierarchical structures existing in the regulatory networks of representative prokaryotes (Escherichia coli) and eukaryotes (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), with most TFs at the bottom levels and only a few master TFs on top. These masters are situated near the center of the protein–protein interaction network, a different type of network from the regulatory one, and they receive most of the input for the whole regulatory hierarchy through protein interactions. Moreover, they have maximal influence over other genes, in terms of affecting expression-level changes. Surprisingly, however, TFs at the bottom of the regulatory hierarchy are more essential to the viability of the cell. Finally, one might think master TFs achieve their wide influence through directly regulating many targets, but TFs with most direct targets are in the middle of the hierarchy. We find, in fact, that these midlevel TFs are “control bottlenecks” in the hierarchy, and this great degree of control for “middle managers” has parallels in efficient social structures in various corporate and governmental settings.},

	abstract = {Motivation
Allele-specific expression (ASE) refers to the differential abundance of the allelic copies of a transcript. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) can provide quantitative estimates of ASE for genes with transcribed polymorphisms. When short-read sequences are aligned to a diploid transcriptome, read-mapping ambiguities confound our ability to directly count reads. Multi-mapping reads aligning equally well to multiple genomic locations, isoforms or alleles can comprise the majority ({\textgreater}85\%) of reads. Discarding them can result in biases and substantial loss of information. Methods have been developed that use weighted allocation of read counts but these methods treat the different types of multi-reads equivalently. We propose a hierarchical approach to allocation of read counts that first resolves ambiguities among genes, then among isoforms, and lastly between alleles. We have implemented our model in EMASE software (Expectation-Maximization for Allele Specific Expression) to estimate total gene expression, isoform usage and ASE based on this hierarchical allocation.

Results
Methods that align RNA-seq reads to a diploid transcriptome incorporating known genetic variants improve estimates of ASE and total gene expression compared to methods that use reference genome alignments. Weighted allocation methods outperform methods that discard multi-reads. Hierarchical allocation of reads improves estimation of ASE even when data are simulated from a non-hierarchical model. Analysis of RNA-seq data from F1 hybrid mice using EMASE reveals widespread ASE associated with cis-acting polymorphisms and a small number of parent-of-origin effects.

In this study, we have developed a deep learning architecture to improve the performance of drug sensitivity prediction based on these data. We integrated both genomic features of cell lines and chemical information of compounds to predict the half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) on the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) datasets using a deep neural network, which we called DeepDSC. Specifically, we first applied a stacked deep autoencoder to extract genomic features of cell lines from gene expression data, and then combined the compounds' chemical features to these genomic features to produce final response data. We conducted 10-fold cross-validation to demonstrate the performance of our deep model in terms of root-mean-square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination R2 . We show that our model outperforms the previous approaches with RMSE of 0.23 and R2 of 0.78 on CCLE dataset, and RMSE of 0.52 and R2 of 0.78 on GDSC dataset, respectively. Moreover, to demonstrate the prediction ability of our models on novel cell lines or novel compounds, we left cell lines originating from the same tissue and each compound out as the test sets, respectively, and the rest as training sets.

	abstract = {Chemotaxis, the motion of cells directed by a gradient of chemoattractant molecules, guides cells in immune response, development, wound healing, and cancer. Unfortunately, this process is difficult to distinguish from chemokinesis, i.e., stimulated random cell motion. Chemotaxis is frequently inferred by determining how many cells cross a boundary in a chemotaxis assay, for example how many cells crawl into a chemoattractant-infused filter, or how many cells enter a defined region in an under-agarose assay or agarose spot assay. To mitigate possible ambiguity in whether motion observed in these assays is directed by the chemoattractant gradient or by chemokinesis, we developed a mathematical model to determine when such methods indeed indicate directed motion of cells. In contrast to previous analyses of chemotaxis assays, we report not just the gradients that arise in the assays but also resulting cell motion. We applied the model to data obtained from rigorous measurements and show, as examples, that MDA-MB-231 breast-cancer cells are at least 20 times less sensitive to gradients of EGF or CXCL12 than neutrophils are to formyl peptides; we then used this information to determine the extent to which gradient sensing increases the rate of boundary crossing relative to a random-motility control. Results show, for example, that in the filter assay, 2–4 times as many neutrophils pass through the filter when exposed to a gradient as when the gradient is absent. However, in the other combinations of cells and assays we considered, only 10–20\% more cells are counted as having migrated in a directed, rather than random, motility condition. We also discuss the design of appropriate controls for these assays, which is difficult for the under-agarose and agarose spot assays. Moreover, although straightforward to perform with the filter assay, reliable controls are often not done. Consequently, we infer that chemotaxis is frequently over-reported, especially for cells like MDA-MB-231 cells, which move slowly and are relatively insensitive to gradients. Such results provide insights into the use of chemotaxis assays, particularly if one wants to acquire and analyze quantitative data.,},

In fact, this method has become so ingrained in certain areas of research that reports often simply state that cells were serum starved without providing any factual details as to how the procedure was carried out. Even so, we quite obviously lack unequivocal terminology, standard protocols, and perhaps most surprisingly, a common conceptual basis when performing serum starvation. Such inconsistencies not only hinder interstudy comparability but can lead to opposing and inconsistent experimental results. Although it is frequently assumed that serum starvation reduces basal activity of cells, available experimental data do not entirely support this notion. To address this important issue, we studied primary human myotubes, rat L6 myotubes and human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells under different serum starvation conditions and followed time-dependent changes in important signaling pathways such as the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, the AMP-activated protein kinase, and the mammalian target of rapamycin. Serum starvation induced a swift and dynamic response, which displayed obvious qualitative and quantitative differences across different cell types and experimental conditions despite certain unifying features. There was no uniform reduction in basal signaling activity. Serum starvation clearly represents a major event that triggers a plethora of divergent responses and has therefore great potential to interfere with the experimental results and affect subsequent conclusions.},

The investigations revealed the decrease of oxygen consumption, net lactate production, ATP-content, NAD-content and NAD-redox potential, and F-actin content with increasing culture density in pm fs, less distinct in 3T3 cells and in SV40-3T3cells. The main decrease of these factors is related to cell-cell contacts rather than to proliferation which ceases at least two division cycles after most cells contacted a neighbouring cell. SV40-3T3cells also at preconfluent densities exhibit relatively low metabolic activity as revealed by the above mentioned factors.

The cell cycle, in particular, is thought to be a key driver of cell-to-cell heterogeneity in gene expression, even in otherwise homogeneous cell populations. Recent advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) facilitate detailed characterization of gene expression heterogeneity, and can thus shed new light on the processes driving heterogeneity. Here, we combined fluorescence imaging with scRNA-seq to measure cell cycle phase and gene expression levels in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Using these data, we developed a novel approach to characterize cell cycle progression. While standard methods assign cells to discrete cell cycle stages, our method goes beyond this, and quantifies cell cycle progression on a continuum. We found that, on average, scRNA-seq data from only five genes predicted a cell’s position on the cell cycle continuum to within 14\% of the entire cycle, and that using more genes did not improve this accuracy. Our data and predictor of cell cycle phase can directly help future studies to account for cell-cycle-related heterogeneity in iPSCs. Our results and methods also provide a foundation for future work to characterize the effects of the cell cycle on expression heterogeneity in other cell types.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The eukaryotic cell cycle is the repeated sequence of events that enable the division of a cell into two daughter cells. It is divided into four phases: G1, S, G2, and M. Passage through the cell cycle is strictly regulated by a molecular interaction network, which involves the periodic synthesis and destruction of cyclins that bind and activate cyclin-dependent kinases that are present in nonlimiting amounts. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors contribute to cell cycle control. Budding yeast is an established model organism for cell cycle studies, and several mathematical models have been proposed for its cell cycle. An area of major relevance in cell cycle control is the G1 to S transition. In any given growth condition, it is characterized by the requirement of a specific, critical cell size, PS, to enter S phase. The molecular basis of this control is still under discussion. The authors report a mathematical model of the G1 to S network that newly takes into account nucleo/cytoplasmic localization, the role of the cyclin-dependent kinase Sic1 in facilitating nuclear import of its cognate Cdk1-Clb5, Whi5 control, and carbon source regulation of Sic1 and Sic1-containing complexes. The model was implemented by a set of ordinary differential equations that describe the temporal change of the concentration of the involved proteins and protein complexes. The model was tested by simulation in several genetic and nutritional setups and was found to be neatly consistent with experimental data. To estimate PS, the authors developed a hybrid model including a probabilistic component for firing of DNA replication origins. Sensitivity analysis of PS provides a novel relevant conclusion: PS is an emergent property of the G1 to S network that strongly depends on growth rate.},

The model is able to replicate and justify the clinical observation of rebound growth when AA therapy is discontinued in some patients. The model is interrogated to derive fundamental insights int cancer biology and on the clinical and biological effects of AA drugs. Invasive cells promote tumor growth, which in the long run exceeds the effects of angiogenesis alone. Furthermore, AA drugs increase the fraction of invasive cells in the tumor, which explain progression by fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) signal and the rebound tumor growth when AA is discontinued.},

Human chromosomes vary in multiple parameters that might generate bias, but technological limitations have precluded a comprehensive analysis of chromosome-specific aneuploidy. Here, by imaging specific centromeres coupled with high-throughput single-cell analysis as well as single-cell sequencing, we show that aneuploidy occurs non-randomly following common treatments to elevate chromosome mis-segregation. Temporary spindle disruption leads to elevated mis-segregation and aneuploidy of a subset of chromosomes, particularly affecting chromosomes 1 and 2. Unexpectedly, we find that a period of mitotic delay weakens centromeric cohesion and promotes chromosome mis-segregation and that chromosomes 1 and 2 are particularly prone to suffer cohesion fatigue. Our findings demonstrate that inherent properties of individual chromosomes can bias chromosome mis-segregation and aneuploidy rates, with implications for studies on aneuploidy in human disease.},

	abstract = {Cancer cells frequently undergo chromosome missegregation events during mitosis, whereby the copies of a given chromosome are not distributed evenly among the two daughter cells, thus creating cells with heterogeneous karyotypes. A stochastic model tracing cellular karyotypes derived from clonal populations over hundreds of generations was recently developed and experimentally validated, and it was capable of predicting favorable karyotypes frequently observed in cancer. Here, we construct and study a Markov chain that precisely describes karyotypic evolution during clonally expanding cancer cell populations. The Markov chain allows us to directly predict the distribution of karyotypes and the expected size of the tumor after many cell divisions without resorting to computationally expensive simulations. We determine the limiting karyotype distribution of an evolving tumor population, and quantify its dependency on several key parameters including the initial karyotype of the founder cell, the rate of whole chromosome missegregation, and chromosome-specific cell viability. Using this model, we confirm the existence of an optimal rate of chromosome missegregation probabilities that maximizes karyotypic heterogeneity, while minimizing the occurrence of nullisomy. Interestingly, karyotypic heterogeneity is significantly more dependent on chromosome missegregation probabilities rather than the number of cell divisions, so that maximal heterogeneity can be reached rapidly (within a few hundred generations of cell division) at chromosome missegregation rates commonly observed in cancer cell lines. Conversely, at low missegregation rates, heterogeneity is constrained even after thousands of cell division events. This leads us to conclude that chromosome copy number heterogeneity is primarily constrained by chromosome missegregation rates and the risk for nullisomy and less so by the age of the tumor. This model enables direct integration of karyotype information into existing models of tumor evolution based on somatic mutations.},

By analyzing {\textgreater}8,200 tumor-normal pairs, we provide statistical evidence suggesting that many more genes possess cancer driver properties than anticipated, forming a continuum of oncogenic potential. Integrating our driver predictions with information on somatic copy number alterations, we find that the distribution and potency of TSGs (STOP genes), OGs, and essential genes (GO genes) on chromosomes can predict the complex patterns of aneuploidy and copy number variation characteristic of cancer genomes.

Due to experimental limitations, fundamental characteristics of karyotypic changes in cancer are poorly understood. Using an experimentally inspired stochastic model, based on the potency and chromosomal distribution of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, we show that cancer cells have evolved to exist within a narrow range of chromosome missegregation rates that optimizes phenotypic heterogeneity and clonal survival. Departure from this range reduces clonal fitness and limits subclonal diversity. Mapping of the aneuploid fitness landscape reveals a highly favorable, commonly observed, near-triploid state onto which evolving diploid- and tetraploid-derived populations spontaneously converge, albeit at a much lower fitness cost for the latter. Finally, by analyzing 1,368 chromosomal translocation events in five human cancers, we find that karyotypic evolution also shapes chromosomal translocation patterns by selecting for more oncogenic derivative chromosomes. Thus, chromosomal instability can generate the heterogeneity required for Darwinian tumor evolution.},

CIN is observed in most solid tumours and is associated with both poor prognosis and drug resistance. Understanding a mechanistic basis for CIN is therefore paramount. Here we find evidence for impaired replication fork progression and increased DNA replication stress in CIN+ colorectal cancer (CRC) cells relative to CIN− CRC cells, with structural chromosome abnormalities precipitating chromosome missegregation in mitosis. We identify three new CIN-suppressor genes (PIGN (also known as MCD4), MEX3C (RKHD2) and ZNF516 (KIAA0222)) encoded on chromosome 18q that are subject to frequent copy number loss in CIN+ CRC. Chromosome 18q loss was temporally associated with aneuploidy onset at the adenoma–carcinoma transition. CIN-suppressor gene silencing leads to DNA replication stress, structural chromosome abnormalities and chromosome missegregation. Supplementing cells with nucleosides, to alleviate replication-associated damage, reduces the frequency of chromosome segregation errors after CIN-suppressor gene silencing, and attenuates segregation errors and DNA damage in CIN+ cells. These data implicate a central role for replication stress in the generation of structural and numerical CIN, which may inform new therapeutic approaches to limit intratumour heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine whether human corneal endothelial cells (HCECs) exhibit signs of oxidative DNA damage and to test whether oxidative stress affects the proliferative capacity of HCECs.
METHODS: Donor human corneas were divided into two age groups: young ({\textless}30 years) and older ({\textgreater}50 years). An 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) ELISA assay was used to quantify oxidative DNA damage in HCECs freshly isolated from ex vivo corneas. 8-OHdG immunostaining localized the sites of oxidative DNA damage in corneal wholemounts and cultured HCECs. To test whether oxidative stress induces oxidative DNA damage, HCECs cultured from young donors were treated with increasing concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and immunostained for 8-OHdG. To test the effect of oxidative stress on proliferative capacity, HCECs cultured from young donors were treated with H(2)O(2) and cell numbers determined by WST-8 assay.
RESULTS: 8-OHdG levels were significantly higher (P = 0.0031) in the central endothelium of older donors than of young donors. Intense nuclear staining for 8-OHdG was observed in central endothelium of older, but not young, donors. The relative intensity of 8-OHdG in the nuclei of cultured HCECs was similar to that observed in ex vivo corneas. Treatment of cultured HCECs from young donors with increasing concentrations of H(2)O(2) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in nuclear 8-OHdG staining and a decrease in proliferative capacity similar to that observed in untreated HCECs from older donors.
CONCLUSIONS: Age-dependent and topographical decreases in proliferative capacity observed in HCECs resulted, at least in part, from nuclear oxidative DNA damage.},

Less is known regarding the molecular basis of protein synthesis regulated by other inputs, such as agonists of the Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling cascade. Ribosomal protein (rp) S6 is a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit that becomes phosphorylated at several serine residues upon mitogen stimulation, but the exact molecular mechanisms regulating its phosphorylation and the function of phosphorylated rpS6 is poorly understood. Here, we provide evidence that activation of the p90 ribosomal S6 kinases (RSKs) by serum, growth factors, tumor promoting phorbol esters, and oncogenic Ras is required for rpS6 phosphorylation downstream of the Ras/ERK signaling cascade. We demonstrate that while ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) phosphorylates rpS6 at all sites, RSK exclusively phosphorylates rpS6 at Ser235/236 in vitro and in vivo using an mTOR-independent mechanism. Mutation of rpS6 at Ser235/236 reveals that phosphorylation of these sites promotes its recruitment to the 7-methylguanosine cap complex, suggesting that Ras/ERK signaling regulates assembly of the translation preinitiation complex. These data demonstrate that RSK provides an mTOR-independent pathway linking the Ras/ERK signaling cascade to the translational machinery.},

Different parts of morphologically heterogeneous astrocytic gliomas were microdissected, and direct DNA sequencing of p53 gene exons 5 through 8 was performed. Thirty-five glioma samples and tumor-adjacent normal-appearing brain tissue from 11 patients were analyzed. Sixteen different p53 gene mutations were found in 7 patients. We found that some tumors were devoid of p53 gene mutations, whereas other tumors carried 1 or often several (up to 3) different mutations. The mutations were present in grade II, III, and IV astrocytic glioma areas. Both severe functionally dead mutants and mutants with remaining transcriptional activity could be observed in the same tumor. We observed that morphologically different parts of a glioma could carry different or similar mutations in the p53 gene and could be either associated or not associated with the locus of heterozygosity at the mutant site. Coexistence of p53 gene mutations and the locus of heterozygosity was common, at least in astrocytomas grade III and in glioblastomas, and also occurred in astrocytoma grade II areas. These results support the notion that intratumoral heterogeneity in brain tumors originates from different molecular defects. Our results are of importance for a further understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind failure to treat glioma patients.},

	abstract = {Cancer is considered an outcome of decades-long clonal evolution fueled by acquisition of somatic genomic abnormalities (SGAs). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown to reduce cancer risk, including risk of progression from Barrett's esophagus (BE) to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA). However, the cancer chemopreventive mechanisms of NSAIDs are not fully understood. We hypothesized that NSAIDs modulate clonal evolution by reducing SGA acquisition rate. We evaluated thirteen individuals with BE. Eleven had not used NSAIDs for 6.2±3.5 (mean±standard deviation) years and then began using NSAIDs for 5.6±2.7 years, whereas two had used NSAIDs for 3.3±1.4 years and then discontinued use for 7.9±0.7 years. 161 BE biopsies, collected at 5-8 time points over 6.4-19 years, were analyzed using 1Million-SNP arrays to detect SGAs. Even in the earliest biopsies there were many SGAs (284±246 in 10/13 and 1442±560 in 3/13 individuals) and in most individuals the number of SGAs changed little over time, with both increases and decreases in SGAs detected. The estimated SGA rate was 7.8 per genome per year (95\% support interval [SI], 7.1-8.6) off-NSAIDs and 0.6 (95\% SI 0.3-1.5) on-NSAIDs. Twelve individuals did not progress to EA. In ten we detected 279±86 SGAs affecting 53±30 Mb of the genome per biopsy per time point and in two we detected 1,463±375 SGAs affecting 180±100 Mb. In one individual who progressed to EA we detected a clone having 2,291±78 SGAs affecting 588±18 Mb of the genome at three time points in the last three of 11.4 years of follow-up. NSAIDs were associated with reduced rate of acquisition of SGAs in eleven of thirteen individuals. Barrett's cells maintained relative equilibrium level of SGAs over time with occasional punctuations by expansion of clones having massive amount of SGAs.},

	abstract = {Through its involvement in over 400 NAD(P)-dependent reactions, niacin status has the potential to influence every area of metabolism. Niacin deficiency has been linked to genomic instability largely through impaired function of the poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) family of enzymes. In various models, niacin deficiency has been found to cause impaired cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, delayed DNA excision repair, accumulation of single and double strand breaks, chromosomal breakage, telomere erosion and cancer development. Rat models suggest that most aspects of genomic instability are minimized by the recommended levels of niacin found in AIN-93 formulations; however, some beneficial responses do occur in the range from adequate up to pharmacological niacin intakes. Mouse models show a wide range of protection against UV-induced skin cancer well into pharmacological levels of niacin intake. It is currently a challenge to compare animal and human data to estimate the role of niacin status in the risk of genomic instability in human populations. It seems fairly certain that some portion of even affluent populations will benefit from niacin supplementation, and some subpopulations are likely well below an optimal intake of this vitamin. With exposure to stressors, like chemotherapy or excess sunlight, suraphysiological doses of niacin may be beneficial.},

Exome sequencing (n=50) and recurrence testing (n=60) reveals that some significantly and frequently altered genes are specific to OSCC-GB (USP9X, MLL4, ARID2, UNC13C and TRPM3), while some others are shared with HNSCC (for example, TP53, FAT1, CASP8, HRAS and NOTCH1). We also find new genes with recurrent amplifications (for example, DROSHA, YAP1) or homozygous deletions (for example, DDX3X) in OSCC-GB. We find a high proportion of C{\textgreater}G transversions among tobacco users with high numbers of mutations. Many pathways that are enriched for genomic alterations are specific to OSCC-GB. Our work reveals molecular subtypes with distinctive mutational profiles such as patients predominantly harbouring mutations in CASP8 with or without mutations in FAT1.

	abstract = {Chromosomal instability (CIN) is associated with poor prognosis in human cancer. However, in certain animal tumor models elevated CIN negatively impacts upon organism fitness, and is poorly tolerated by cancer cells. To better understand this seemingly contradictory relationship between CIN and cancer cell biological fitness and its relationship with clinical outcome, we applied the CIN70 expression signature, which correlates with DNA-based measures of structural chromosomal complexity and numerical CIN in vivo, to gene expression profiles of 2,125 breast tumors from 13 published cohorts. Tumors with extreme CIN, defined as the highest quartile CIN70 score, were predominantly of the estrogen receptor negative (ER(-)), basal-like phenotype and displayed the highest chromosomal structural complexity and chromosomal numerical instability. We found that the extreme CIN/ER(-) tumors were associated with improved prognosis relative to tumors with intermediate CIN70 scores in the third quartile. We also observed this paradoxical relationship between CIN and prognosis in ovarian, gastric, and non-small cell lung cancer, with poorest outcome in tumors with intermediate, rather than extreme, CIN70 scores. These results suggest a nonmonotonic relationship between gene signature expression and HR for survival outcome, which may explain the difficulties encountered in the identification of prognostic expression signatures in ER(-) breast cancer. Furthermore, the data are consistent with the intolerance of excessive CIN in carcinomas and provide a plausible strategy to define distinct prognostic patient cohorts with ER(-) breast cancer. Inclusion of a surrogate measurement of CIN may improve cancer risk stratification and future therapeutic approaches.},

	volume = {77},
	issn = {0008-543X},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many pathologists require the presence of tumor necrosis within an astrocytic neoplasm to establish the diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme (GM). Two new grading systems for astrocytic neoplasms allow a tumor to be diagnosed at the highest level of anaplasia without requiring the presence of tumor necrosis.
METHODS: To determine whether GMs without necrosis had biologic behavior most compatible with a diagnosis of GM or of anaplastic astrocytoma (AA), we examined the survival of 299 patients whose tumors were diagnosed as GM because they contained endothelial proliferation and who were treated according to prospective clinical protocols. Multivariate proportional-hazards survival analysis was used to assess the importance of tumor necrosis after adjustment for other prognostic factors.
RESULTS: Of 275 patients with GMs containing endothelial proliferation, 88\% had tumor necrosis. Absence of necrosis was associated with younger age and with less extensive surgical resection. The absence of necrosis predicted longer survival in univariate analysis (P = 0.02) and after adjustment for age, Karnofsky performance score, and extent of resection in a multivariate analysis (P = 0.04). However, the magnitude of the survival difference was not clinically important: patients without tumor necrosis had a median survival of 12.5 months, and those with tumor necrosis had a median survival of 10.9 months. Kaplan-Meier survival rates two years after diagnosis were 13.0\% for patients with necrosis and 27.1\% for patients without necrosis; the difference in 2-year survival was not statistically significant (difference in survival rates = 14.1\%, 95\% confidence interval -2.2\% to 30.4\%).
CONCLUSIONS: The survival of patients with astrocytic neoplasms containing endothelial proliferation and no necrosis conforms best to the pattern expected for patients with GM rather than AA. This supports the classification of these tumors as GM in the revised World Health Organization grading system and as grade 4 astrocytomas in the St. Anne-Mayo grading system.},

These studies involve the sequencing of matched tumour–normal samples followed by mathematical analysis to identify those genes in which mutations occur more frequently than expected by random chance. Here we describe a fundamental problem with cancer genome studies: as the sample size increases, the list of putatively significant genes produced by current analytical methods burgeons into the hundreds. The list includes many implausible genes (such as those encoding olfactory receptors and the muscle protein titin), suggesting extensive false-positive findings that overshadow true driver events. We show that this problem stems largely from mutational heterogeneity and provide a novel analytical methodology, MutSigCV, for resolving the problem. We apply MutSigCV to exome sequences from 3,083 tumour–normal pairs and discover extraordinary variation in mutation frequency and spectrum within cancer types, which sheds light on mutational processes and disease aetiology, and in mutation frequency across the genome, which is strongly correlated with DNA replication timing and also with transcriptional activity. By incorporating mutational heterogeneity into the analyses, MutSigCV is able to eliminate most of the apparent artefactual findings and enable the identification of genes truly associated with cancer.},

In 43\% of cases, at least half of the mutations in the initial tumor were undetected at recurrence, including driver mutations in TP53, ATRX, SMARCA4, and BRAF, suggesting recurrent tumors are often seeded by cells derived from the initial tumor at a very early stage of their evolution. Notably, tumors from 6 of 10 patients treated with the chemotherapeutic drug temozolomide (TMZ) followed an alternative evolutionary path to high-grade glioma.

	abstract = {Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is frequently multifocal (mPTC), with synchronous tumour foci often showing varied morphology. The genetic mechanisms underlying the development of multiple and histologically diverse tumour foci remain uncertain. Different tumour foci might develop either through intrathyroidal dissemination of a single malignant clone, with morphotype differentiation occurring as a result of subclonal progression, or they may stem from independent transformational events involving multiple progenitor clones. To determine the clonal derivation of multiple tumour foci and to map their clonal relationships and genetic progression in mPTC, we evaluated genome-wide allelic imbalances (AI) and BRAF V600E mutation status in 55 synchronous tumour foci from 18 mPTC patients. For apparently monoclonal tumours, we calculated the probabilities of monoclonal derivation and used phylogenetic analysis to model clonal evolution. Genome-wide allelotyping and BRAF mutation analysis showed genetic alterations consistent with monoclonal origin in 83\% of cases, mostly with evidence of subclonal evolution. BRAF V600E mutations were early events during clonal evolution of most, but not all cases. MPTC with morphologically diverse tumour foci also arose through monoclonal derivation in 75\% of cases, demonstrating that morphotype-determining genetic changes can be acquired during clonal diversification, subsequent to the spread of the original malignant progenitor clone. In 17\% of patients, discordant AI or BRAF V600E profiles implied that mPTCs can occasionally develop from distinct transformation events. This study suggests that mPTC originates usually from neoplastic transformation and subsequent intrathyroidal spread of a single malignant progenitor clone. Clonal progression and morphotype differentiation occur through progressive acquisition of genetic alterations subsequent to the initial intra-glandular spread. In monoclonal BRAF V600E-positive mPTCs, BRAF V600E is not always present in all tumour foci, indicating that other tumour-genetic factors in the primary progenitor clone can also trigger PTC neoplastic transformation.},

	abstract = {We utilized abundant transcriptomic data for the primary classes of brain cancers to study the feasibility of separating all of these diseases simultaneously based on molecular data alone. These signatures were based on a new method reported herein – Identification of Structured Signatures and Classifiers (ISSAC) – that resulted in a brain cancer marker panel of 44 unique genes. Many of these genes have established relevance to the brain cancers examined herein, with others having known roles in cancer biology. Analyses on large-scale data from multiple sources must deal with significant challenges associated with heterogeneity between different published studies, for it was observed that the variation among individual studies often had a larger effect on the transcriptome than did phenotype differences, as is typical. For this reason, we restricted ourselves to studying only cases where we had at least two independent studies performed for each phenotype, and also reprocessed all the raw data from the studies using a unified pre-processing pipeline. We found that learning signatures across multiple datasets greatly enhanced reproducibility and accuracy in predictive performance on truly independent validation sets, even when keeping the size of the training set the same. This was most likely due to the meta-signature encompassing more of the heterogeneity across different sources and conditions, while amplifying signal from the repeated global characteristics of the phenotype. When molecular signatures of brain cancers were constructed from all currently available microarray data, 90\% phenotype prediction accuracy, or the accuracy of identifying a particular brain cancer from the background of all phenotypes, was found. Looking forward, we discuss our approach in the context of the eventual development of organ-specific molecular signatures from peripheral fluids such as the blood., From a multi-study, integrated transcriptomic dataset, we identified a marker panel for differentiating major human brain cancers at the gene-expression level. The ISSAC molecular signatures for brain cancers, composed of 44 unique genes, are based on comparing expression levels of pairs of genes, and phenotype prediction follows a diagnostic hierarchy. We found that sufficient dataset integration across multiple studies greatly enhanced diagnostic performance on truly independent validation sets, whereas signatures learned from only one dataset typically led to high error rate. Molecular signatures of brain cancers, when obtained using all currently available gene-expression data, achieved 90\% phenotype prediction accuracy. Thus, our integrative approach holds significant promise for developing organ-level, comprehensive, molecular signatures of disease.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Medulloblastomas are heterogeneous tumors that collectively represent the most common malignant brain tumor in children. To understand the molecular characteristics underlying their heterogeneity and to identify whether such characteristics represent risk factors for patients with this disease, we performed an integrated genomic analysis of a large series of primary tumors.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We profiled the mRNA transcriptome of 194 medulloblastomas and performed high-density single nucleotide polymorphism array and miRNA analysis on 115 and 98 of these, respectively. Non-negative matrix factorization-based clustering of mRNA expression data was used to identify molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma; DNA copy number, miRNA profiles, and clinical outcomes were analyzed for each. We additionally validated our findings in three previously published independent medulloblastoma data sets.
RESULTS: Identified are six molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma, each with a unique combination of numerical and structural chromosomal aberrations that globally influence mRNA and miRNA expression. We reveal the relative contribution of each subgroup to clinical outcome as a whole and show that a previously unidentified molecular subgroup, characterized genetically by c-MYC copy number gains and transcriptionally by enrichment of photoreceptor pathways and increased miR-183∼96∼182 expression, is associated with significantly lower rates of event-free and overall survivals.
CONCLUSION: Our results detail the complex genomic heterogeneity of medulloblastomas and identify a previously unrecognized molecular subgroup with poor clinical outcome for which more effective therapeutic strategies should be developed.},

To address this, we developed a unique surgical multisampling scheme to collect spatially distinct tumor fragments from 11 GB patients. We present an integrated genomic analysis that uncovers extensive intratumor heterogeneity, with most patients displaying different GB subtypes within the same tumor. Moreover, we reconstructed the phylogeny of the fragments for each patient, identifying copy number alterations in EGFR and CDKN2A/B/p14ARF as early events, and aberrations in PDGFRA and PTEN as later events during cancer progression. We also characterized the clonal organization of each tumor fragment at the single-molecule level, detecting multiple coexisting cell lineages. Our results reveal the genome-wide architecture of intratumor variability in GB across multiple spatial scales and patient-specific patterns of cancer evolution, with consequences for treatment design.},

Eosinophil infiltration in the resected tumor was detected in 157 patients (24\%). The intensive degree of infiltration correlates well with a special pathologic type of cancer, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, the size of tumor mass and preoperative blood eosinophila. The extract from tumors with the marked eosinophilic infiltration was highly chemotactic for eosinophils in vitro. The eosinophil chemotactic activity was found to be heat-labile and nondialyzable.

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Identification of somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in tumour genomes is a necessary step in defining the mutational landscapes of cancers. Experimental designs for genome-wide ascertainment of somatic mutations now routinely include next-generation sequencing (NGS) of tumour DNA and matched constitutional DNA from the same individual. This allows investigators to control for germline polymorphisms and distinguish somatic mutations that are unique to the tumour, thus reducing the burden of labour-intensive and expensive downstream experiments needed to verify initial predictions. In order to make full use of such paired datasets, computational tools for simultaneous analysis of tumour-normal paired sequence data are required, but are currently under-developed and under-represented in the bioinformatics literature.
RESULTS: In this contribution, we introduce two novel probabilistic graphical models called JointSNVMix1 and JointSNVMix2 for jointly analysing paired tumour-normal digital allelic count data from NGS experiments. In contrast to independent analysis of the tumour and normal data, our method allows statistical strength to be borrowed across the samples and therefore amplifies the statistical power to identify and distinguish both germline and somatic events in a unified probabilistic framework.

	abstract = {A humanized monoclonal antibody against ERBB2 is used in neoadjuvant therapy for patients with gastric cancer. A critical factor in determining patient eligibility and predicting outcomes of this therapy is the intratumoral heterogeneity of ERBB2 amplification in gastric adenocarcinomas. The aims of this study are to assess the underlying mechanisms of intratumoral heterogeneity of ERBB2 amplification; to characterize the diversity of coamplified oncogenes such as EGFR, FGFR2, MET, MYC, CCND1, and MDM2; and to examine the usefulness of multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) in the semicomprehensive detection of these gene amplifications. A combined analysis of immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed ERBB2-amplified cancer cells in 51 of 475 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded gastric adenocarcinomas. The fraction of amplification-positive cells in each tumor ranged from less than 10\% to almost 100\%. Intratumoral heterogeneity of ERBB2 amplification, defined as less than 50\% of cancer cells positive for ERBB2 amplification, was found in 41\% (21/51) of ERBB2-amplified tumors. The combined analysis of MLPA and fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that ERBB2 was coamplified with EGFR in 7 tumors, FGFR2 in 1 tumor, and FGFR2 and MET in 1 tumor; however, the respective genes were amplified in mutually exclusive cells. Coamplified ERBB2 and MYC coexisted within single nuclei in 4 tumors, and one of these cases had suspected coamplification in the same amplicon of ERBB2 with MYC. In conclusion, the amplification status of ERBB2 and other genes can be obtained semicomprehensively by MLPA and could be useful to plan individualized molecularly targeted therapy against gastric cancers.},

	abstract = {Background
Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. Despite recent improvements in cure rates, prediction of disease outcome remains a major challenge and survivors suffer from serious therapy-related side-effects. Recent data showed that patients with WNT-activated tumors have a favorable prognosis, suggesting that these patients could be treated less intensively, thereby reducing the side-effects. This illustrates the potential benefits of a robust classification of medulloblastoma patients and a detailed knowledge of associated biological mechanisms.

Methods and Findings
To get a better insight into the molecular biology of medulloblastoma we established mRNA expression profiles of 62 medulloblastomas and analyzed 52 of them also by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) arrays. Five molecular subtypes were identified, characterized by WNT signaling (A; 9 cases), SHH signaling (B; 15 cases), expression of neuronal differentiation genes (C and D; 16 and 11 cases, respectively) or photoreceptor genes (D and E; both 11 cases). Mutations in β-catenin were identified in all 9 type A tumors, but not in any other tumor. PTCH1 mutations were exclusively identified in type B tumors. CGH analysis identified several fully or partly subtype-specific chromosomal aberrations. Monosomy of chromosome 6 occurred only in type A tumors, loss of 9q mostly occurred in type B tumors, whereas chromosome 17 aberrations, most common in medulloblastoma, were strongly associated with type C or D tumors. Loss of the inactivated X-chromosome was highly specific for female cases of type C, D and E tumors. Gene expression levels faithfully reflected the chromosomal copy number changes. Clinicopathological features significantly different between the 5 subtypes included metastatic disease and age at diagnosis and histology. Metastatic disease at diagnosis was significantly associated with subtypes C and D and most strongly with subtype E. Patients below 3 yrs of age had type B, D, or E tumors. Type B included most desmoplastic cases. We validated and confirmed the molecular subtypes and their associated clinicopathological features with expression data from a second independent series of 46 medulloblastomas.

Conclusions
The new medulloblastoma classification presented in this study will greatly enhance the understanding of this heterogeneous disease. It will enable a better selection and evaluation of patients in clinical trials, and it will support the development of new molecular targeted therapies. Ultimately, our results may lead to more individualized therapies with improved cure rates and a better quality of life.},

	doi = {10.1056/NEJMoa0808710},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A recent genomewide mutational analysis of glioblastomas (World Health Organization [WHO] grade IV glioma) revealed somatic mutations of the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 gene (IDH1) in a fraction of such tumors, most frequently in tumors that were known to have evolved from lower-grade gliomas (secondary glioblastomas).
METHODS: We determined the sequence of the IDH1 gene and the related IDH2 gene in 445 central nervous system (CNS) tumors and 494 non-CNS tumors. The enzymatic activity of the proteins that were produced from normal and mutant IDH1 and IDH2 genes was determined in cultured glioma cells that were transfected with these genes.
RESULTS: We identified mutations that affected amino acid 132 of IDH1 in more than 70\% of WHO grade II and III astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas and in glioblastomas that developed from these lower-grade lesions. Tumors without mutations in IDH1 often had mutations affecting the analogous amino acid (R172) of the IDH2 gene. Tumors with IDH1 or IDH2 mutations had distinctive genetic and clinical characteristics, and patients with such tumors had a better outcome than those with wild-type IDH genes. Each of four tested IDH1 and IDH2 mutations reduced the enzymatic activity of the encoded protein.
CONCLUSIONS: Mutations of NADP(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases encoded by IDH1 and IDH2 occur in a majority of several types of malignant gliomas.},

	abstract = {Here we report the identification of a proliferative, viable, and hyperdiploid tumor cell subpopulation present within Glioblastoma (GB) patient tumors. Using xenograft tumor models, we demonstrate that hyperdiploid cell populations are maintained in xenograft tumors and that clonally expanded hyperdiploid cells support tumor formation and progression in vivo. In some patient tumorsphere lines, hyperdiploidy is maintained during long-term culture and in vivo within xenograft tumor models, suggesting that hyperdiploidy can be a stable cell state. In other patient lines hyperdiploid cells display genetic drift in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that in these patients hyperdiploidy is a transient cell state that generates novel phenotypes, potentially facilitating rapid tumor evolution. We show that the hyperdiploid cells are resistant to conventional therapy, in part due to infrequent cell division due to a delay in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. Hyperdiploid tumor cells are significantly larger and more metabolically active than euploid cancer cells, and this correlates to an increased sensitivity to the effects of glycolysis inhibition. Together these data identify GB hyperdiploid tumor cells as a potentially important subpopulation of cells that are well positioned to contribute to tumor evolution and disease recurrence in adult brain cancer patients, and suggest tumor metabolism as a promising point of therapeutic intervention against this subpopulation.},

Approximately 2 billion people are infected with M. tuberculosis, and almost 1.5 million people die annually from TB. With increasing drug resistance and few novel drug candidates, our inability to effectively treat all infected individuals necessitates a deeper understanding of the host-pathogen interface to facilitate new approaches to treatment. In addition, the current anti-tuberculosis regimen requires months of strict compliance to clear infection; targeting host immune function could play a strategic role in reducing the duration and complexity of treatment while effectively treating drug-resistant strains. Here we use a microscopy-based screen to identify molecules that target host pathways and inhibit the growth of M. tuberculosis in macrophages. We identified several host pathways not previously implicated in tuberculosis. The identified inhibitors prevent growth either by blocking host pathways exploited by M. tuberculosis for virulence, or by activating immune responses that target intracellular bacteria. Fluoxetine, used clinically for treating depression, induces autophagy and enhances production of TNF-α. Similarly, gefitinib, used clinically for treating cancer, inhibits M. tuberculosis growth in macrophages. Importantly, gefitinib treatment reduces bacterial replication in the lungs of M. tuberculosis-infected mice.},

This insidious feature arises inevitably in almost all cancers and has great significance for the general outcome of the malignancy, because it confounds our understanding of the disease and also intrinsically contributes to the tumor's aggressiveness and poses an obstacle to the design of effective therapies. The classic view that heterogeneity arises as the result of a tumor's "genetic chaos" and the more contemporary cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis tend to identify a single cell population as the therapeutic target: the prevailing clone over time in the first case and the CSC in the latter. However, there is growing evidence that the different tumor cell populations may not be simple bystanders. Rather, they can establish a complex network of interactions between each other and with the tumor microenvironment that eventually strengthens tumor growth and increases chances to escape therapy. These differing but complementary ideas about the origin and maintenance of tumor heterogeneity and its importance in GBM are reviewed here.},

Forty-five non-CNS tissues were also profiled to allow for comparative analyses. Using principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering, we were able to show that the expression patterns of the 20 CNS sites profiled were significantly different from all non-CNS tissues and were also similar to one another, indicating an underlying common expression signature. By focusing our analyses on the 20 sites of the CNS, we were able to show that these 20 sites could be segregated into discrete groups with underlying similarities in anatomical structure and, in many cases, functional activity. These findings suggest that gene expression data can help define CNS function at the molecular level. We have identified subsets of genes with the following patterns of expression: (1) across the CNS, suggesting homeostatic/housekeeping function; (2) in subsets of functionally related sites of the CNS identified by our unsupervised learning analyses; and (3) in single sites within the CNS, indicating their participation in distinct site-specific functions. By performing network analyses on these gene sets, we identified many pathways that are upregulated in particular sites of the CNS, some of which were previously described in the literature, validating both our dataset and approach. In summary, we have generated a database of gene expression that can be used to gain valuable insight into the molecular characterization of functions carried out by different sites of the human CNS.},

Criteria used to categorize patients as high risk included M1-4 disease by modified Chang staging classification, T3b/T4 disease, or greater than 1.5 cm(3) of residual tumor after surgery. Postoperatively, children with high-risk medulloblastoma were randomly assigned to two arms, either chemotherapy entailing three cycles of cisplatin and etoposide before radiation (chemotherapy first [CT1]) or the same chemotherapy regimen after radiation (radiation therapy first [RT1]). Both groups received consolidation chemotherapy consisting of vincristine and cyclophosphamide. Results The median follow-up time was 6.4 years. Five-year EFS was 66.0\% in the CT1 arm and 70.0\% in the RT1 arm (P = .54), and 5-year overall survival in the two groups was 73.1\% and 76.1\%, respectively (P = .47). In the CT1 arm, 40 of the 62 patients with residual disease achieved either complete or partial remission.

Using cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models, we show that high-level FGFR2 amplification initiates a distinct oncogene addiction phenotype, characterized by FGFR2-mediated transactivation of alternative receptor kinases, bringing PI3K/mTOR signaling under FGFR control. Signaling in low-level FGFR1-amplified cancers is more restricted to MAPK signaling, limiting sensitivity to FGFR inhibition. Finally, we show that circulating tumor DNA screening can identify high-level clonally amplified cancers.

RESULTS: High MATH (a MATH value above the median) was found to be significantly associated with shorter overall survival (hazards ratio, 2.5; 95\% confidence interval, 1.3-4.8). MATH was similarly found to be associated with adverse outcomes in clinically high-risk patients with an advanced stage of disease, and in those with tumors classified as high risk on the basis of validated biomarkers including those that were negative for human papillomavirus or having disruptive tumor protein p53 mutations. In patients who received chemotherapy, the hazards ratio for high MATH was 4.1 (95\% confidence interval, 1.6-10.2). CONCLUSIONS: This novel measure of tumor genetic heterogeneity is significantly associated with tumor progression and adverse treatment outcomes, thereby supporting the hypothesis that higher genetic heterogeneity portends a worse clinical outcome in patients with HNSCC. The prognostic value of some known biomarkers may be the result of their association with high genetic heterogeneity. MATH provides a useful measure of that heterogeneity to be prospectively validated as NGS data from homogeneously treated patient cohorts become available Cancer 2013. © 2013 American Cancer Society.},

	abstract = {Cancer genomic instability contributes to the phenomenon of intratumoral genetic heterogeneity, provides the genetic diversity required for natural selection, and enables the extensive phenotypic diversity that is frequently observed among patients. Genomic instability has previously been associated with poor prognosis. However, we have evidence that for solid tumors of epithelial origin, extreme levels of genomic instability, where more than 75\% of the genome is subject to somatic copy number alterations, are associated with a potentially better prognosis compared with intermediate levels under this threshold. This has been observed in clonal subpopulations of larger size, especially when genomic instability is shared among a limited number of clones. We hypothesize that cancers with extreme levels of genomic instability may be teetering on the brink of a threshold where so much of their genome is adversely altered that cells rarely replicate successfully. Another possibility is that tumors with high levels of genomic instability are more immunogenic than other cancers with a less extensive burden of genetic aberrations. Regardless of the exact mechanism, but hinging on our ability to quantify how a tumor's burden of genetic aberrations is distributed among coexisting clones, genomic instability has important therapeutic implications. Herein, we explore the possibility that a high genomic instability could be the basis for a tumor's sensitivity to DNA-damaging therapies.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recurrence and/or metastasis occurs in more than half of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), and these events pose the greatest threats to long-term survival. We set out to identify genetic alterations that underlie recurrent/metastatic HNSCC.
METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed on genomic DNA extracted from fresh-frozen whole blood and patient-matched tumor pairs from 13 HNSCC patients with synchronous lymph node metastases and 10 patients with metachronous recurrent tumors. Mutational concordance within and between tumor pairs was used to analyze the spatiotemporal evolution of HNSCC in individual patients and to identify potential therapeutic targets for functional evaluation.
RESULTS: Approximately 86\% and 60\% of single somatic nucleotide variants (SSNVs) identified in synchronous nodal metastases and metachronous recurrent tumors, respectively, were transmitted from the primary index tumor. Genes that were mutated in more than one metastatic or recurrent tumor, but not in the respective primary tumors, include C17orf104, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, type 3 (ITPR3), and discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (DDR2). Select DDR2 mutations have been shown to confer enhanced sensitivity to SRC-family kinase (SFK) inhibitors in other malignancies. Similarly, HNSCC cell lines harboring endogenous and engineered DDR2 mutations were more sensitive to the SFK inhibitor dasatinib than those with WT DDR2.
CONCLUSION: In this WES study of patient-matched tumor pairs in HNSCC, we found synchronous lymph node metastases to be genetically more similar to their paired index primary tumors than metachronous recurrent tumors. This study outlines a compendium of somatic mutations in primary, metastatic, and/or recurrent HNSCC cancers, with potential implications for precision medicine approaches.

Human nucleotide excision repair generates two incisions surrounding the site of damage, creating an ∼30-mer. In XR-seq, this fragment is isolated and subjected to high-throughput sequencing. We used XR-seq to produce stranded, nucleotide-resolution maps of repair of two UV-induced DNA damages in human cells: cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and (6-4) pyrimidine–pyrimidone photoproducts [(6-4)PPs]. In wild-type cells, CPD repair was highly associated with transcription, specifically with the template strand. Experiments in cells defective in either transcription-coupled excision repair or general excision repair isolated the contribution of each pathway to the overall repair pattern and showed that transcription-coupled repair of both photoproducts occurs exclusively on the template strand. XR-seq maps capture transcription-coupled repair at sites of divergent gene promoters and bidirectional enhancer RNA (eRNA) production at enhancers. XR-seq data also uncovered the repair characteristics and novel sequence preferences of CPDs and (6-4)PPs. XR-seq and the resulting repair maps will facilitate studies of the effects of genomic location, chromatin context, transcription, and replication on DNA repair in human cells.},

Despite advances in the study of molecular biology of cancer genes, relatively little is known about evolutionary mechanisms that drive neoplastic progression. It is unknown, for example, which may be more predictive of future progression of a neoplasm: genetic homogenization of the neoplasm, possibly caused by a clonal expansion, or the accumulation of clonal diversity. Here, in a prospective study, we show that clonal diversity measures adapted from ecology and evolution can predict progression to adenocarcinoma in the premalignant condition known as Barrett's esophagus, even when controlling for established genetic risk factors, including lesions in TP53 (p53; ref. 6) and ploidy abnormalities. Progression to cancer through accumulation of clonal diversity, on which natural selection acts, may be a fundamental principle of neoplasia with important clinical implications.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Several cancer types consist of multiple, genetically and phenotypically distinct subpopulations. The underlying mechanism for this intra-tumoral heterogeneity can be explained by the clonal evolution model, whereby growth advantageous mutations cause the expansion of cancer cell subclones. The recurrent phenotype of many cancers may be a consequence of these coexisting subpopulations responding unequally to therapies. Methods to computationally infer tumor evolution and subpopulation diversity are emerging and they hold the promise to improve the understanding of the genetic and molecular determinants of recurrence.
RESULTS: To address cellular subpopulation dynamics within human tumors, we developed a bioinformatic method, EXPANDS. It estimates the proportion of cells harboring specific mutations in a tumor. By modeling cellular frequencies as probability distributions, EXPANDS predicts mutations that accumulate in a cell prior to its clonal expansion. We assessed the performance of EXPANDS on one whole genome sequenced breast cancer and performed SP analyses on 118 Glioblastoma multiforme samples obtained from TCGA. Our results inform about the extent of subclonal diversity in primary GBM, subpopulation dynamics upon recurrence and provide a set of candidate genes mutated in the most well adapted subpopulations. In summary, EXPANDS predicts tumor purity and subclonal composition from sequencing data.

We surveyed the spectrum of somatic alterations in gastric cancer by sequencing the exomes of 15 gastric adenocarcinomas and their matched normal DNAs. Frequently mutated genes in the adenocarcinomas included TP53 (11/15 tumors), PIK3CA (3/15) and ARID1A (3/15). Cell adhesion was the most enriched biological pathway among the frequently mutated genes. A prevalence screening confirmed mutations in FAT4, a cadherin family gene, in 5\% of gastric cancers (6/110) and FAT4 genomic deletions in 4\% (3/83) of gastric tumors. Frequent mutations in chromatin remodeling genes (ARID1A, MLL3 and MLL) also occurred in 47\% of the gastric cancers. We detected ARID1A mutations in 8\% of tumors (9/110), which were associated with concurrent PIK3CA mutations and microsatellite instability. In functional assays, we observed both FAT4 and ARID1A to exert tumor-suppressor activity. Somatic inactivation of FAT4 and ARID1A may thus be key tumorigenic events in a subset of gastric cancers.},

An increasing number of tumors have now shown loss of SMARCB1 protein expression by immunohistochemistry, including the majority of epithelioid sarcomas. However, investigations of SMARCB1 gene alterations in epithelioid sarcoma have produced conflicting results. The aim of this study was to evaluate SMARCB1 status using Sanger sequencing of the coding region and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, a rapid and sensitive method for detecting intragenic deletions and duplications, which has not been used in previous studies. Twenty-one epithelioid sarcomas of both classical and proximal type were selected for SMARCB1 gene testing and SMARCB1 immunohistochemistry. Nineteen of 21 (90\%) epithelioid sarcomas were SMARCB1 negative by immunohistochemistry. Twelve of the 19 (63\%) had adequate DNA recovery for evaluation. Ten of 12 (83\%) tumors showed homozygous deletions of the gene. Two cases showed heterozygous deletions and polymorphisms, but no sequence mutations. These results confirm the high frequency of SMARCB1 deletions in epithelioid sarcoma and show that multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification is a reliable method for detection of deletions in these cases, which can be performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. Given the high percentage of SMARCB1 alterations in epithelioid sarcoma, these findings argue against using SMARCB1 gene deletion as a tool in distinguishing them from malignant rhabdoid tumors.},

	abstract = {1. The electrophysiological effects of CI-980, a new tubulin-binding agent that inhibits assembly of cytoplasmic microtubules, on transmembrane action potential characteristics were studied in right ventricular papillary muscles from guinea-pig hearts. 2. In papillary muscles driven at 1 Hz, CI-980 at concentrations {\textgreater} or = 10(-5) M produced a concentration-dependent increase in the maximum upstroke velocity (Vmax) and a lengthening of the action potential duration at 50\% (APD50) and 90\% (APD90) of repolarization without affecting the resting membrane potential. Prolongation of the APD90 was accompanied by a parallel lengthening of the effective refractory period (ERP) so that the ERP/APD90 ratio remained unaltered at all drug concentrations tested. 3. CI-980 exhibits a reverse use-dependent effect on APD90 values, that is, drug-induced APD90 prolongation become exagerated at slow rates and attenuated at fast rates. 4. CI-980 at concentrations {\textgreater} or = 10(-6) M lengthened the APD of the slow action potentials elicited by isoprenaline in papillary muscles depolarized by high K+ (27 mM) solution. 5. At 10(-5) M, CI-980 produced a small tonic Vmax block. However, in muscles driven at rates between 0.5 and 3 Hz it produced an exponential decline in Vmax (use-dependent Vmax block) which was augmented at higher rates of stimulation. At 3 Hz the onset kinetics of the use-dependent Vmax block was fitted by a monoexponential function with a K value 0.07 +/- 0.01 per AP. The recovery time constant (tau re) from the use-dependent Vmax block was prolonged from 21.6 +/- 2.6 ms to 3.5 +/- 0.2 s. 6. The curve relating membrane potential and Vmax was shifted by CI-980 (10(-5) M) in the hyperpolarizing direction by 2.3 +/- 1.1 mV. 7. It is concluded that in guinea-pig papillary muscles, CI-980 produces a use-dependent inhibition of Vmax and a reverse use-dependent prolongation of the ventricular action potential, thus exhibiting class I and class III antiarrhythmic actions, respectively. From the onset and offset kinetics of use-dependent Vmax block, CI-980 can be considered to be an intermediate kinetics (IA) Na+ channel blocker.},

Such competition also can promote rapid phenotypic evolution and ecological divergence. This process may end with the stable occupation of distinct niches or, alternatively, may entail repeated bouts of evolution. Here we examine two Escherichia coli lineages, called L and S, that coexisted for more than 30,000 generations after diverging from a common ancestor. Both lineages underwent sustained phenotypic evolution based on global transcription and resource utilization profiles, with L seeming to encroach over time on the catabolic profile of S. Reciprocal invasion experiments with L and S clones from the same or different generations revealed evolutionary changes in their interaction, including an asymmetry that confirmed the encroachment by L on the niche of the S lineage. In general, L and S clones from the same generation showed negative frequency-dependent effects, consistent with stable coexistence. However, L clones could invade S clones from both earlier and later generations, whereas S clones could invade only L clones from earlier generations. In this system, the long-term coexistence of competing lineages evidently depended on successive rounds of evolution, rather than on initial divergence followed by a static equilibrium.},

Separation of these two tumor types is crucial because the prognosis for ATT/RhT is given even when treatment includes surgery with or without radio and/or chemotherapy. These tumors are most common in infants less than 2 years of age. The cases described in this study arose in intracranially in all but one instance, although one-third had already spread throughout the subarachnoid space at presentation. Clinical signs and symptoms and radiological features do not distinguish ATT/RhTs from PNETs. The tumors are composed entirely (13\%) or partly (77\%) or rhabdoid cells. Seventy percent contains fields of typical PNET alone or in combinations with mesenchymal and/r epithelial elements. The immunohistochemical profile is unique: epithelial membrane antigen, vimentin, and smooth-muscle actin are positive in the majority of tumors and markers for germ-cell tumors are consistently negative. Abnormalities of chromosome 22 distinguish ATT/RhTs from PNETs, which typically display an i(17q) abnormality.},

We treated a transposon–driven, functional genomic mouse model of medulloblastoma with ‘humanized’ in vivo therapy (microneurosurgical tumour resection followed by multi-fractionated, image-guided radiotherapy). Genetic events in recurrent murine medulloblastoma exhibit a very poor overlap with those in matched murine diagnostic samples ({\textless}5\%). Whole-genome sequencing of 33 pairs of human diagnostic and post-therapy medulloblastomas demonstrated substantial genetic divergence of the dominant clone after therapy ({\textless}12\% diagnostic events were retained at recurrence). In both mice and humans, the dominant clone at recurrence arose through clonal selection of a pre-existing minor clone present at diagnosis. Targeted therapy is unlikely to be effective in the absence of the target, therefore our results offer a simple, proximal, and remediable explanation for the failure of prior clinical trials of targeted therapy.},

We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach through differential analysis of lung fibroblasts in response to loss of the developmental transcription factor HOXA1, which we show is required for lung fibroblast and HeLa cell cycle progression. Loss of HOXA1 results in significant expression level changes in thousands of individual transcripts, along with isoform switching events in key regulators of the cell cycle.

In this study, we discovered that metastasis-associated protein S100A4 interacts with the Rho-binding domain (RBD) of Rhotekin, thus connecting S100A4 to the Rho pathway. Glutathione S-transferase pull-down and immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that S100A4 specifically and directly binds to Rhotekin RBD, but not the other Rho effector RBDs. S100A4 binding to Rhotekin is calcium-dependent and uses residues distinct from those bound by active Rho. Interestingly, we found that S100A4 and Rhotekin can form a complex with active RhoA. Using RNA interference, we determined that suppression of both S100A4 and Rhotekin leads to loss of Rho-dependent membrane ruffling in response to epidermal growth factor, an increase in contractile F-actin 'stress' fibers and blocks invasive growth in three-dimensional culture. Accordingly, our data suggest that interaction of S100A4 and Rhotekin permits S100A4 to complex with RhoA and switch Rho function from stress fiber formation to membrane ruffling to confer an invasive phenotype.},

Employing genetic, genomic, and imaging approaches, we examined the dynamics of response to a mainstay chemotherapeutic, cisplatin, in multiple mouse models of human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We show that lung tumors initially respond to cisplatin by sensing DNA damage, undergoing cell cycle arrest, and inducing apoptosis—leading to a significant reduction in tumor burden. Importantly, we demonstrate that this response does not depend on the tumor suppressor p53 or its transcriptional target, p21. Prolonged cisplatin treatment promotes the emergence of resistant tumors with enhanced repair capacity that are cross-resistant to platinum analogs, exhibit advanced histopathology, and possess an increased frequency of genomic alterations. Cisplatin-resistant tumors express elevated levels of multiple DNA damage repair and cell cycle arrest-related genes, including p53-inducible protein with a death domain (Pidd). We demonstrate a novel role for PIDD as a regulator of chemotherapy response in human lung tumor cells.},

We applied this method to sequence single normal and tumour nuclei from an oestrogen-receptor-positive (ER(+)) breast cancer and a triple-negative ductal carcinoma. In parallel, we performed single nuclei copy number profiling. Our data show that aneuploid rearrangements occurred early in tumour evolution and remained highly stable as the tumour masses clonally expanded. In contrast, point mutations evolved gradually, generating extensive clonal diversity. Using targeted single-molecule sequencing, many of the diverse mutations were shown to occur at low frequencies ({\textless}10\%) in the tumour mass. Using mathematical modelling we found that the triple-negative tumour cells had an increased mutation rate (13.3×), whereas the ER(+) tumour cells did not.

RESULTS: The median OS for patients treated with multiagent chemotherapy (n=79) was 17.3 months (range, 1.5-93 mo); unrelated to age at diagnosis, sex, tumor site, and extent of resection. Overall mortality was 67\%. Disease progression (craniospinal spread in 58\%) was the major cause of death. Patients (n=30) treated with intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy had significantly higher 2-year OS [64\% (95\% confidence interval, 46.5-82.0) vs. 17.3\% (95\% confidence interval, 5.4-29.3); P{\textless}0.0001] and lower prevalence of distant CNS metastasis compared with those without IT therapy (n=49) (20\% vs. 59.2\%; P=0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite dismal OS, multimodal therapy can induce remission even in metastatic CNS ATRT with partial resection. IT chemotherapy results in higher OS and, because of an overall high rate of distant relapse, should be considered in future trials.},

Great strides have been made in understanding brain cancer genetics and modeling these tumors with new targeted therapies being tested but these advances have not translated into substantially improved patient outcomes. Multiple chemotherapeutic agents, including temozolomide, the first-line treatment for glioblastoma, have been developed to kill cancer cells. However, the response to temozolomide in GBM is modest. Radiation is also moderately effective but this approach is plagued by limitations due to collateral radiation damage to healthy brain tissue and development of radioresistance. Therapeutic resistance is attributed at least in part to a cell population within the tumor that possesses stem-like characteristics and tumor propagating capabilities, referred to as cancer stem cells. Within GBM, the intratumoral heterogeneity is derived from a combination of regional genetic variance and a cellular hierarchy often regulated by distinct cancer stem cell niches, most notably perivascular and hypoxic regions. With the recent emergence as a key player in tumor biology, cancer stem cells have symbiotic relationships with the tumor microenvironment, oncogenic signaling pathways, and epigenetic modifications. The origins of cancer stem cells and their contributions to brain tumor growth and therapeutic resistance are under active investigation with novel anti-cancer stem cell therapies offering potential new hope for this lethal disease.},

For most cancer types, this landscape consists of a small number of "mountains" (genes altered in a high percentage of tumors) and a much larger number of "hills" (genes altered infrequently). To date, these studies have revealed {\textasciitilde}140 genes that, when altered by intragenic mutations, can promote or "drive" tumorigenesis. A typical tumor contains two to eight of these "driver gene" mutations; the remaining mutations are passengers that confer no selective growth advantage. Driver genes can be classified into 12 signaling pathways that regulate three core cellular processes: cell fate, cell survival, and genome maintenance. A better understanding of these pathways is one of the most pressing needs in basic cancer research. Even now, however, our knowledge of cancer genomes is sufficient to guide the development of more effective approaches for reducing cancer morbidity and mortality.},

With the extensive genomic information now available on tumors it is possible to conduct analyses to reveal common genetic features across cancer types and to explore whether the established anatomy-based tumor classification is actually reflected on the genetic level, which might provide important guides to new therapeutic directions. Here, we have conducted an extensive analysis of the genetic similarity of tumors from 14 major cancer entities using somatic mutation data from 4,796 cases available through The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) based on all available genes as well as different cancer-related gene sets. Our analysis provides a systematic account of the genetic similarity network for major cancer types and shows that in about 43\% of the cases on average, tumors of a particular anatomic site are genetically more similar to tumors from different organs and tissues (trans-similarity) than to tumors of the same origin (self-similarity). The observed similarities exist not only for carcinomas from different sites but are also present among neoplasms from different tissue origin, such as melanoma, AML and glioblastoma. The current WHO cancer classification is therefore reflected on the genetic level by only about 57\% of the tumors. These results provide a rationale to reconsider organ- and tissue-specificity in cancer and contribute to the discussion about whether personalized therapies targeting specific genetic alterations may be transferred to cancers from other anatomic sites with similar genetic properties. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Histopathological studies of AT/RT showed that in addition to the commonly recognized components, i.e., rhabdoid cells, small (PNET/MB) cells, spindle cells and epithelial components, there was a previously unrecognized component, sickle-shaped embracing cells, which were present in all cases and could be useful as a histological marker of this tumor. Immunohistochemical studies showed divergent differentiation of the tumor cells and among the 16 antibodies studied, vimentin, neuron-specific enolase, epithelial membrane antigen and glial fibrillary acidic protein were most commonly reactive. The frequency of AT/RT expressed as a ratio of AT/RT to PNET/MB was 1:11 in general and increased to 1:3.8 among patients younger than 3 years old. The AT/RT patients were younger than those with PNET/MB and had a female predominance. The MIB-1 labeling index of AT/RT was significantly higher than that of PNET/MB (mean 63.9 vs 40.1), which correlated with a shorter survival in patients with AT/RT than those with PNET/MB (median survival time 15.4 months vs 156.4 months).},

While the prevalence of polyploid lineages indicates that this phenomenon is a common and successful evolutionary transition, whether polyploidization itself has a significant effect on patterns and rates of diversification remains an open question. Here we review evidence for the creative role of polyploidy in evolution. We present new estimates for the incidence of polyploidy in ferns and flowering plants based on a simple model describing transitions between odd and even base chromosome numbers. These new estimates indicate that ploidy changes may represent from 2 to 4\% of speciation events in flowering plants and 7\% in ferns. Speciation via polyploidy is likely to be one of the more predominant modes of sympatric speciation in plants, owing to its potentially broad-scale effects on gene regulation and developmental processes, effects that can produce immediate shifts in morphology, breeding system, and ecological tolerances. Theoretical models support the potential for increased adaptability in polyploid lineages. The evidence suggests that polyploidization can produce shifts in genetic systems and phenotypes that have the potential to result in increased evolutionary diversification, yet conclusive evidence that polyploidy has changed rates and patterns of diversification remains elusive.},

Objective: To identify mechanisms for cancer resistance in elephants and compare cellular response to DNA damage among elephants, healthy human controls, and cancer-prone patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS).
Design, Setting, and Participants: A comprehensive survey of necropsy data was performed across 36 mammalian species to validate cancer resistance in large and long-lived organisms, including elephants (n = 644). The African and Asian elephant genomes were analyzed for potential mechanisms of cancer resistance. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from elephants, healthy human controls, and patients with LFS were tested in vitro in the laboratory for DNA damage response. The study included African and Asian elephants (n = 8), patients with LFS (n = 10), and age-matched human controls (n = 11). Human samples were collected at the University of Utah between June 2014 and July 2015.
Exposures: Ionizing radiation and doxorubicin.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Cancer mortality across species was calculated and compared by body size and life span. The elephant genome was investigated for alterations in cancer-related genes. DNA repair and apoptosis were compared in elephant vs human peripheral blood lymphocytes.
Results: Across mammals, cancer mortality did not increase with body size and/or maximum life span (eg, for rock hyrax, 1\% [95\% CI, 0\%-5\%]; African wild dog, 8\% [95\% CI, 0\%-16\%]; lion, 2\% [95\% CI, 0\%-7\%]). Despite their large body size and long life span, elephants remain cancer resistant, with an estimated cancer mortality of 4.81\% (95\% CI, 3.14\%-6.49\%), compared with humans, who have 11\% to 25\% cancer mortality. While humans have 1 copy (2 alleles) of TP53, African elephants have at least 20 copies (40 alleles), including 19 retrogenes (38 alleles) with evidence of transcriptional activity measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. In response to DNA damage, elephant lymphocytes underwent p53-mediated apoptosis at higher rates than human lymphocytes proportional to TP53 status (ionizing radiation exposure: patients with LFS, 2.71\% [95\% CI, 1.93\%-3.48\%] vs human controls, 7.17\% [95\% CI, 5.91\%-8.44\%] vs elephants, 14.64\% [95\% CI, 10.91\%-18.37\%]; P {\textless} .001; doxorubicin exposure: human controls, 8.10\% [95\% CI, 6.55\%-9.66\%] vs elephants, 24.77\% [95\% CI, 23.0\%-26.53\%]; P {\textless} .001).
Conclusions and Relevance: Compared with other mammalian species, elephants appeared to have a lower-than-expected rate of cancer, potentially related to multiple copies of TP53. Compared with human cells, elephant cells demonstrated increased apoptotic response following DNA damage. These findings, if replicated, could represent an evolutionary-based approach for understanding mechanisms related to cancer suppression.},

We approached these problems by developing a classification system based on DNA microarray gene expression data derived from 99 patient samples. Here we demonstrate that medulloblastomas are molecularly distinct from other brain tumours including primitive neuroectodermal tumours (PNETs), atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumours (AT/RTs) and malignant gliomas. Previously unrecognized evidence supporting the derivation of medulloblastomas from cerebellar granule cells through activation of the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) pathway was also revealed. We show further that the clinical outcome of children with medulloblastomas is highly predictable on the basis of the gene expression profiles of their tumours at diagnosis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We used the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to ask how elevated mutation rates affect the evolution of asexual eukaryotic populations. Mismatch repair defective and nonmutator strains were competed during adaptation to four laboratory environments (rich medium, low glucose, high salt, and a nonfermentable carbon source).
RESULTS: In diploids, mutators have an advantage over nonmutators in all conditions, and mutators that win competitions are on average fitter than nonmutator winners. In contrast, haploid mutators have no advantage when competed against haploid nonmutators, and haploid mutator winners are less fit than nonmutator winners. The diploid mutator winners were all superior to their ancestors both in the condition they had adapted to, and in two of the other conditions. This phenotype was due to a mutation or class of mutations that confers a large growth advantage during the respiratory phase of yeast cultures that precedes stationary phase. This generalist mutation(s) was not selected in diploid nonmutator strains or in haploid strains, which adapt primarily by fixing specialist (condition-specific) mutations. In diploid mutators, such mutations also occur, and the majority accumulates after the fixation of the generalist mutation.
CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the advantage of mutators depends on ploidy and that diploid mutators can give rise to beneficial mutations that are inaccessible to nonmutators and haploid mutators.},

	abstract = {The local concentration of DNA in metaphase chromosomes of different organisms has been determined in several laboratories. The average of these measurements is 0.17 g/mL. In the first level of chromosome condensation, DNA is wrapped around histones forming nucleosomes. This organization limits the DNA concentration in nucleosomes to 0. 3-0.4 g/mL. Furthermore, in the structural models suggested in different laboratories for the 30-40 nm chromatin fiber, the estimated DNA concentration is significantly reduced; it ranges from 0.04 to 0.27 g/mL. The DNA concentration is further reduced when the fiber is folded into the successive higher order structures suggested in different models for metaphase chromosomes; the estimated minimum decrease of DNA concentration represents an additional 40\%. These observations suggest that most of the models proposed for the 30-40 nm chromatin fiber are not dense enough for the construction of metaphase chromosomes. In contrast, it is well-known that the linear packing ratio increases dramatically in each level of DNA folding in chromosomes. Thus, the consideration of the linear packing ratio is not enough for the study of chromatin condensation; the constraint resulting from the actual DNA concentration in metaphase chromosomes must be considered for the construction of models for condensed chromatin.},

	abstract = {Medulloblastoma encompasses a collection of clinically and molecularly diverse tumour subtypes that together comprise the most common malignant childhood brain tumour. These tumours are thought to arise within the cerebellum, with approximately 25\% originating from granule neuron precursor cells (GNPCs) after aberrant activation of the Sonic Hedgehog pathway (hereafter, SHH subtype). The pathological processes that drive heterogeneity among the other medulloblastoma subtypes are not known, hindering the development of much needed new therapies. Here we provide evidence that a discrete subtype of medulloblastoma that contains activating mutations in the WNT pathway effector CTNNB1 (hereafter, WNT subtype) arises outside the cerebellum from cells ofthe dorsal brainstem. We found that genes marking human WNT-subtype medulloblastomas are more frequently expressed in the lower rhombic lip (LRL) and embryonic dorsal brainstem than in the upper rhombic lip (URL) and developing cerebellum. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and intra-operative reports showed that human WNT-subtype tumours infiltrate the dorsal brainstem, whereas SHH-subtype tumours are located within the cerebellar hemispheres. Activating mutations in Ctnnb1 had little impact on progenitor cell populations in the cerebellum, but caused the abnormal accumulation of cells on the embryonic dorsal brainstem which included aberrantly proliferating Zic1+ precursor cells. These lesions persisted in all mutant adult mice; moreover, in 15\% of cases in which Tp53 was concurrently deleted, they progressed to form medulloblastomas that recapitulated the anatomy and gene expression profiles of human WNT-subtype medulloblastoma. We provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, that subtypes of medulloblastoma have distinct cellular origins. Our data provide an explanation for the marked molecular and clinical differences between SHH- and WNT-subtype medulloblastomas and have profound implications for future research and treatment of this important childhood cancer.},

In this study, we aimed to assess in vivo telomere length and the presence of specific proteins involved in telomere regulation in a model of human skeletal muscle with (patients with dermatomyosis or polymyositis) and without ongoing regenerative events (healthy subjects). Mean (meanTRF) and minimal telomere (miniTRF) lengths and the expression of telomerase, tankyrase 1, TRF2 (telomeric repeat binding factor 2) and POT1 (protection of telomeres 1) were investigated in skeletal muscle samples from 12 patients (MYO) and 13 healthy subjects (CON). There was no significant shortening of telomeres in skeletal muscle from patients compared with control subjects (MYO, meanTRF length 11.0 ± 1.8 kbp and miniTRF length 4.7 ± 0.8 kbp; CON, meanTRF length 10.4 ± 1.1 kbp and miniTRF length 4.6 ± 0.5 kbp). Theoretically, telomere length can be controlled by endogenous mechanisms. Here, we show for the first time that expression levels of telomerase, tankyrase 1, TRF2 and POT1 were, respectively, six-, seven-, three- and fivefold higher in the nuclear fraction of skeletal muscle of MYO compared with CON (P {\textless} 0.05). This suggests the existence of endogenous mechanisms allowing for telomere regulation in skeletal muscle with ongoing cycles of degeneration and regeneration and a model where regulatory factors are possibly involved in the protection of skeletal muscle telomeres.},

It links molecular-level cell cycle checkpoint control information to clonal growth cancer model to predict the possible shapes of the dose response curves of Ionizing Radiation (IR) induced tumor transformation frequency. J-shaped dose response curves have been captured with consideration of cell cycle checkpoint control mechanisms. The simulation results indicate the shape of the dose response curve relates to the behavior of the saddle-node points of the model in the bifurcation diagram. A simplified version of the model in previous work of the authors was used mathematically to analyze behaviors relating to the saddle-node points for the J-shaped dose response curve. It indicates that low-linear energy transfer (LET) is more likely to have a J-shaped dose response curve. This result emphasizes the significance of systems biology approach, which encourages collaboration of multidiscipline of biologists, toxicologists and mathematicians, to illustrate complex cancer-related events, and confirm the biphasic dose-response at low doses.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Stem-like tumor propagating cells (TPCs) isolated from malignant astrocytoma (MA) are reportedly therapy-resistant. In contrast, progenitor-like TPCs with loss of asymmetric cell division (Cancer Cell. 20:328-40; 2011) are sensitive to temozolomide (Cancer Cell. 18:669-82; 2010). In a pediatric MA subset, an activating BRAFT1799A mutation leads to expression of hyperactivated BRafV600E kinase, and occurs with deletion of the cell cycle inhibitor CDKN2A (Cancer Res. 70:512-9; 2010). BRAFV600E-targeted therapies, including PLX4720, retard the growth of intracranial BRAFV600E MA xenografts (Clin. Cancer Res. 17:7595-604; 2011). Studies suggest that TPCs defined by current methods are not a homogeneous population and may contain subpopulations that respond differently to treatment. The divergent effects of targeted therapies on heterogeneous TPCs have yet to be explored. METHODS: Stem-like (CD133+) and progenitor-like (NG2+) cells were isolated from human MA cell lines and murine neurosphere cells with BRafV600E expression and Ink4a/Arf (CDKN2A) deletion. CD133+ and NG2+ cells labeled with proliferation markers were investigated for heterogeneity in cell cycle dynamics and division modes. Viability assays were used to determine PLX4720 IC50s, and RT-PCR was used to analyze cell cycle and polarity regulator gene expression. Pharmacological modulators of genes altered in NG2+ and CD133+ cells were tested alongside PLX4720 for anti-tumor efficacy in intracranial BRAFV600E MA xenografts. RESULTS: In murine CD133+ cells with BRafV600E expression and CDKN2A deletion, a low proliferation frequency and high rate of asymmetric division associate with reduced sensitivity to PLX4720-induced G1 arrest. Human CD133+ but not isogenic NG2+ cells have differential mRNA expression of G2-specific cell cycle regulators. Concurrently, CD133+ cells exhibit enhanced sensitivity to blockade of polo-like-kinase1 (PLK1), a cell cycle and polarity regulator. Results from ongoing analyses of the distinct proliferative capacities, cell cycle dynamics, cell division mode and responses to targeted BRafV600E and PLK1 inhibition of CD133+ and NG2+ MA cells will be presented. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies revealed that murine malignant astrocytoma TPCs are phenotypically and functionally heterogeneous. We further discovered a TPC-subpopulation specific therapy response, where CD133+ cells from malignant astrocytoma cell lines are more resistant to BRafV600E targeted inhibition but more sensitive to G2/M checkpoint kinase inhibition than NG2+ cells. This provides a potential mechanistic basis for the differential responses of stem and progenitor-like TPCs to treatment. Understanding why current treatment strategies preferentially target only certain cell-types will allow intelligent design of chemotherapeutic strategies with greater anti-tumor effects.

	abstract = {Malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRT) are extremely aggressive pediatric tumors caused by the inactivation of the hSNF5/INI1 tumor suppressor gene, which encodes a core member of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. Roles for hSNF5/INI1 in cell cycle and differentiation have been documented. Based on the observation that MRTs are highly invasive, we investigated a role for hSNF5/INI1 in cell migration. MRT cell lines exhibit high migration properties that are dramatically reduced upon hSNF5/INI1 expression. This effect is associated with the disorganization of the actin stress fiber network and is mediated by the inhibition of the activity of the small GTPase RhoA, through a nuclear, SWI/SNF-dependent transcriptional mechanism. We further show that the knockdown of hSNF5/INI1 in epithelial 293T or MCF7 cells results in increased cell size, loss of cell-cell adhesions, and enhanced migration, associated with an increased RhoA activity. Finally, we show that the SNF5 homology domain is required for hSNF5/INI1-mediated inhibition of migration, and that a missense mutation (S284L) associated with cancer is sufficient to impair hSNF5/INI1 function in migration. We conclude that the inhibition of migration is another crucial tumor suppressor function of hSNF5/INI1, in addition to its previously described functions in proliferation and differentiation, and that its loss-of-function in MRTs may account for the high invasiveness and metastatic potential of these tumors.},

Advanced esophageal adenocarcinomas (EAs) have high levels of somatic copy number alterations. Barrett's esophagus (BE) is a risk factor for developing EA, and somatic chromosomal alterations (SCAs) are known to occur in BE. The vast majority ({\textasciitilde}95\%) of individuals with BE do not progress to EA during their lifetimes, but a small subset develop EA, many of which arise rapidly even in carefully monitored patients without visible endoscopic abnormalities at the index endoscopy. Using a well-designed, longitudinal case-cohort study, we characterized SCA as assessed by SNP arrays over space and time in 79 "progressors" with BE as they approach the diagnosis of cancer and 169 "nonprogressors" with BE who did not progress to EA over 20,425 person-months of follow-up. The genomes of nonprogressors typically had small localized deletions involving fragile sites and 9p loss/copy neutral LOH that generate little genetic diversity and remained relatively stable over prolonged follow-up. As progressors approach the diagnosis of cancer, their genomes developed chromosome instability with initial gains and losses, genomic diversity, and selection of SCAs followed by catastrophic genome doublings. Our results support a model of differential disease dynamics in which nonprogressor genomes largely remain stable over prolonged periods whereas progressor genomes evolve significantly increased SCA and diversity within four years of EA diagnosis, suggesting a window of opportunity for early detection.},

By using a clonogenic survival assay, we show here that concomitant administration of trifluoperazine at a subtoxic concentration enhances the cytotoxicity of bleomycin. Moreover, trifluoperazine also increases the longevity of bleomycin-induced DNA strand breaks in U1810 cells, as shown by both comet assay and fraction of activity released (FAR)-assay. This action seems to be related to suppression of cellular DNA DSB repair activities because NHEJ-mediated rejoining of DSBs occurs with significantly lower efficiency in the presence of trifluoperazine. We propose that TFP might be capable of inhibiting one or more elements of the DNA DSB repair machinery, thereby increasing the cytotoxicity of bleomycin in lung cancer cells.},

Here we present MuTect, a method that applies a Bayesian classifier to detect somatic mutations with very low allele fractions, requiring only a few supporting reads, followed by carefully tuned filters that ensure high specificity. We also describe benchmarking approaches that use real, rather than simulated, sequencing data to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity as a function of sequencing depth, base quality and allelic fraction. Compared with other methods, MuTect has higher sensitivity with similar specificity, especially for mutations with allelic fractions as low as 0.1 and below, making MuTect particularly useful for studying cancer subclones and their evolution in standard exome and genome sequencing data.

	abstract = {A note about nomenclature
The ortholog of the gene mutated in rhabdoid tumors was first studied in yeast where it was identified in a screen for mutants incapable of fermenting sucrose. It was thus given the name Sucrose Non-Fermenting gene number 5 (SNF5) and was subsequently found to be a member of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. The human ortholog of the gene was identified in a screen for proteins capable of interacting with the integrase protein of the human immunodeficiency virus and was given the name INtegrase Interactor 1 (INI1). Investigators studying a mammalian version of the Swi/Snf complex felt that its function may have diverged somewhat from the yeast complex and thus proposed renaming the complex the Brg1/Brm Associated Factors complex, or BAF complex. The rhabdoid tumor gene was thus given the name BAF47 based upon its apparent molecular mass of 47 Kd. Most recently, the genetic nomenclature committee bestowed the name SMARCB1 for SWI/SNF related, Matrix associated, Actin dependent Regulator of Chromatin, subfamily B, member 1. Each of these names has been used extensively in the literature and we ourselves have referred to the gene as either SNF5 (CWMR) or INI1 (JAB). In an effort to simplify communication, we have chosen to use the official SMARCB1 nomenclature here.},

However, less is known about the role of mutations. Here we sequenced the exomes of 50 lethal, heavily pre-treated metastatic CRPCs obtained at rapid autopsy (including three different foci from the same patient) and 11 treatment-naive, high-grade localized prostate cancers. We identified low overall mutation rates even in heavily treated CRPCs (2.00 per megabase) and confirmed the monoclonal origin of lethal CRPC. Integrating exome copy number analysis identified disruptions of CHD1 that define a subtype of ETS gene family fusion-negative prostate cancer. Similarly, we demonstrate that ETS2, which is deleted in approximately one-third of CRPCs (commonly through TMPRSS2:ERG fusions), is also deregulated through mutation. Furthermore, we identified recurrent mutations in multiple chromatin- and histone-modifying genes, including MLL2 (mutated in 8.6\% of prostate cancers), and demonstrate interaction of the MLL complex with the AR, which is required for AR-mediated signalling. We also identified novel recurrent mutations in the AR collaborating factor FOXA1, which is mutated in 5 of 147 (3.4\%) prostate cancers (both untreated localized prostate cancer and CRPC), and showed that mutated FOXA1 represses androgen signalling and increases tumour growth. Proteins that physically interact with the AR, such as the ERG gene fusion product, FOXA1, MLL2, UTX (also known as KDM6A) and ASXL1 were found to be mutated in CRPC. In summary, we describe the mutational landscape of a heavily treated metastatic cancer, identify novel mechanisms of AR signalling deregulated in prostate cancer, and prioritize candidates for future study.},

	abstract = {Unless diagnosed early, many adult cancers remain incurable diseases. This is despite an intense global research effort to develop effective anticancer therapies, calling into question the use of rational drug design strategies in targeting complex disease states such as cancer. A fundamental challenge facing researchers and clinicians is that cancers are inherently robust biological systems, able to survive, adapt and proliferate despite the perturbations resulting from anticancer drugs. It is essential that the mechanisms underlying tumor robustness be formally studied and characterized, as without a thorough understanding of the principles of tumor robustness, strategies to overcome therapy resistance are unlikely to be found. Degeneracy describes the ability of structurally distinct system components (e.g. proteins, pathways, cells, organisms) to be conditionally interchangeable in their contribution to system traits and it has been broadly implicated in the robustness and evolvability of complex biological systems. Here we focus on one of the most important mechanisms underpinning tumor robustness and degeneracy, the cellular heterogeneity that is the hallmark of most solid tumors. Based on a combination of computational, experimental and clinical studies we argue that stochastic noise is an underlying cause of tumor heterogeneity and particularly degeneracy. Drawing from a number of recent data sets, we propose an integrative model for the evolution of therapy resistance, and discuss recent computational studies that propose new therapeutic strategies aimed at defeating the adaptable cancer phenotype.},

Tumor cell populations are apparently more genetically unstable than normal cells, perhaps from activation of specific gene loci in the neoplasm, continued presence of carcinogen, or even nutritional deficiencies within the tumor. The acquired genetic insta0ility and associated selection process, most readily recognized cytogenetically, results in advanced human malignancies being highly individual karyotypically and biologically. Hence, each patient's cancer may require individual specific therapy, and even this may be thwarted by emergence of a genetically variant subline resistant to the treatment.

	abstract = {RATIONALE: Cancer stem cell (CSC) theory has drawn much attention, with evidence supporting the contribution of stem cells to tumor initiation, relapse, and therapy resistance.
OBJECTIVES: To screen drugs that target CSCs to improve the current treatment outcome and overcome drug resistance in patients with lung cancer.
METHODS: We used publicly available embryonic stem cell and CSC-associated gene signatures to query the Connectivity Map for potential drugs that can, at least in part, reverse the gene expression profile of CSCs. High scores were noted for several phenothiazine-like antipsychotic drugs, including trifluoperazine. We then treated lung CSCs with different EGFR mutation status with trifluoperazine to examine its anti-CSC properties. Lung CSCs resistant to epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor or cisplatin were treated with trifluoperazine plus gefitinib or trifluoperazine plus cisplatin. Animal models were used for in vivo validation of the anti-CSC effect and synergistic effect of trifluoperazine with gefitinib. Measurements and Main Results: We demonstrated that trifluoperazine inhibited CSC tumor spheroid formation and down-regulated the expression of CSC markers (CD44/CD133). Trifluoperazine inhibited Wnt/β-catenin signaling in gefitinib-resistant lung cancer spheroids. The combination of trifluoperazine with either gefitinib or cisplatin overcame drug resistance in lung CSCs. Trifluoperazine inhibited the tumor growth and enhanced the inhibitory activity of gefitinib in lung cancer metastatic and orthotopic CSC animal models.
CONCLUSIONS: Using in silico drug screening by Connectivity Map followed by empirical validations, we repurposed an existing phenothiazine-like antipsychotic drug, trifluoperazine, as a potential anti-CSC agent that could overcome epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor and chemotherapy resistance.},

	abstract = {Human solid tumors frequently have pronounced heterogeneity of both neoplastic and normal cells on the histological, genetic, and gene expression levels. While current efforts are focused on understanding heterotypic interactions between tumor cells and surrounding normal cells, much less is known about the interactions between and among heterogeneous tumor cells within a neoplasm. In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) amplification and mutation (EGFRvIII/DeltaEGFR) are signature pathogenetic events that are invariably expressed in a heterogeneous manner. Strikingly, despite its greater biological activity than wild-type EGFR (wtEGFR), individual GBM tumors expressing both amplified receptors typically express wtEGFR in far greater abundance than the DeltaEGFR lesion. We hypothesized that the minor DeltaEGFR-expressing subpopulation enhances tumorigenicity of the entire tumor cell population, and thereby maintains heterogeneity of expression of the two receptor forms in different cells. Using mixtures of glioma cells as well as immortalized murine astrocytes, we demonstrate that a paracrine mechanism driven by DeltaEGFR is the primary means for recruiting wtEGFR-expressing cells into accelerated proliferation in vivo. We determined that human glioma tissues, glioma cell lines, glioma stem cells, and immortalized mouse Ink4a/Arf(-/-) astrocytes that express DeltaEGFR each also express IL-6 and/or leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) cytokines. These cytokines activate gp130, which in turn activates wtEGFR in neighboring cells, leading to enhanced rates of tumor growth. Ablating IL-6, LIF, or gp130 uncouples this cellular cross-talk, and potently attenuates tumor growth enhancement. These findings support the view that a minor tumor cell population can potently drive accelerated growth of the entire tumor mass, and thereby actively maintain tumor cell heterogeneity within a tumor mass. Such interactions between genetically dissimilar cancer cells could provide novel points of therapeutic intervention.},

We apply single-nucleus sequencing to investigate tumour population structure and evolution in two human breast cancer cases. Analysis of 100 single cells from a polygenomic tumour revealed three distinct clonal subpopulations that probably represent sequential clonal expansions. Additional analysis of 100 single cells from a monogenomic primary tumour and its liver metastasis indicated that a single clonal expansion formed the primary tumour and seeded the metastasis. In both primary tumours, we also identified an unexpectedly abundant subpopulation of genetically diverse 'pseudodiploid' cells that do not travel to the metastatic site.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Aspirin is associated with a reduced risk of developing colorectal cancer. This study examined whether patients with colorectal cancer prescribed aspirin had improved survival.
DESIGN: An observational population cohort study was undertaken using data linkage of cancer registry, dispensed prescriptions and death certificate records in Tayside, Scotland. All community prescribed aspirin pre- and post-diagnosis was extracted and periods of aspirin use post-diagnosis for each individual were analysed using Cox proportional hazard models. Main outcome measures were all-cause and colorectal mortality from death certificates.
RESULTS: Two thousand nine hundred ninety patients were identified with colorectal cancer between 1st January 1997 and 30th December 2006 and followed up until 28th February 2010. Median age at diagnosis was 73 (interquartile range [IQR] 65-80) with 52\% male. One thousand nine hundred ninety-eight (67\%) deaths were recorded with 1021 (34\%) attributed to colorectal cancer. One thousand three hundred forty (45\%) patients used aspirin at some stage of the study period. Aspirin use post-diagnosis was associated with lower risk of all cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR]=0.67, 95\% confidence interval [CI]=0.57-0.79, p{\textless}0.001) and colorectal cancer specific mortality after allowing for age, Dukes' stage, gender, socio-economic status and aspirin use pre-diagnosis. Increasing age and stage at diagnosis were associated with increased risk, with more affluent patients at reduced risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that aspirin use post-diagnosis of colorectal cancer may reduce both all cause and colorectal cancer specific mortality. However further work is required to ensure this is a causal relationship and to identify whether it is best used in specific groups of patients.},

	abstract = {Background: The value of a combined index of neutrophil and white cell counts, named derived neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio (dNLR), has recently been proposed as a prognosticator of survival in various cancer types. We investigated the prognostic role of the dNLR in a large European cohort of patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC).
Methods: Data from 171 non-metastatic UTUC patients, operated between 1990 and 2012 at a single tertiary academic centre, were evaluated retrospectively. Cancer-specific- (CSS) as well as overall survival (OS) were assessed using the Kaplan–Meier method. To evaluate the independent prognostic significance of the dNLR, multivariate proportional Cox-regression models were applied. Additionally, the influence of the dNLR on the predictive accuracy of the multivariate model was further determined by Harrell’s concordance index (c-index).
Results: The median follow-up period was 31 months. An increased dNLR was statistically significantly associated with shorter CSS (log-rank P=0.004), as well as with shorter OS (log-rank P=0.002). Multivariate analysis identified dNLR as an independent predictor for CSS (hazard ratio, HR=1.16, 95\% confidence interval, CI=1.01–1.35, P=0.045), as well as for OS (HR=1.21, 95\% CI=1.09–1.34, P{\textless}0.001). The estimated c-index of the multivariate model for OS was 0.68 without dNLR and 0.73 when dNLR was added.
Conclusions: Patients with a high pretreatment dNLR could be predicted to show subsequently higher cancer-specific- as well as overall mortality after surgery for UTUC compared with those with a low pretreatment dNLR. Thus, this combined index should be considered as a potential prognostic biomarker in future.},

	abstract = {The contribution of whole-genome doubling to chromosomal instability (CIN) and tumor evolution is unclear. We use long-term culture of isogenic tetraploid cells from a stable diploid colon cancer progenitor to investigate how a genome-doubling event affects genome stability over time. Rare cells that survive genome doubling demonstrate increased tolerance to chromosome aberrations. Tetraploid cells do not exhibit increased frequencies of structural or numerical CIN per chromosome. However, the tolerant phenotype in tetraploid cells, coupled with a doubling of chromosome aberrations per cell, allows chromosome abnormalities to evolve specifically in tetraploids, recapitulating chromosomal changes in genomically complex colorectal tumors. Finally, a genome-doubling event is independently predictive of poor relapse-free survival in early-stage disease in two independent cohorts in multivariate analyses [discovery data: hazard ratio (HR), 4.70, 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.04-21.37; validation data: HR, 1.59, 95\% CI, 1.05-2.42]. These data highlight an important role for the tolerance of genome doubling in driving cancer genome evolution.
SIGNIFICANCE: Our work sheds light on the importance of whole-genome–doubling events in colorectal cancer evolution. We show that tetraploid cells undergo rapid genomic changes and recapitulate the genetic alterations seen in chromosomally unstable tumors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a genome-doubling event is prognostic of poor relapse-free survival in this disease type.},

We have developed a tetracycline-based hSNF5/INI1-inducible system in a hSNF5/INI1-deficient malignant rhabdoid tumor cell line and studied time course variation of 22,000 genes/expressed sequence tags upon hSNF5/INI1 induction. A total of 482 responsive genes were identified and further clustered into 9 groups of coregulated genes. Among genes with early and strong inductions, the use of a fusion protein with the hormone-binding domain of the estrogen receptor enabled the identification of a subset of direct targets regulated independently of de novo protein synthesis. We show that the G(1) arrest induced by hSNF5/INI1 is reversible and associated with the down-regulation of components of the DNA replication complex. We also identify an unsuspected role of hSNF5/INI1 in cytoskeleton organization. Indeed, induction of hSNF5/INI1 induces dramatic modifications of the cell shape including complete disruption of the actin stress fiber network and disappearance of focal adhesions associated with up-regulation of genes involved in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. We document a strong decrease of Rho activity upon hSNF5/INI1 expression, suggesting that the regulation of this activity constitutes a crucial step of the hSNF5/INI1-induced reorganization of the actin network. This study identifies hSNF5/INI1 target genes and provides evidence that hSNF5/INI1 may modulate the cell cycle control and cytoskeleton organization through the regulation of the retinoblastoma protein-E2F and Rho pathways.},

We further used the gene expression profiles to calculate the 'transcriptomic age' of an individual, and show that differences between transcriptomic age and chronological age are associated with biological features linked to ageing, such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting glucose, and body mass index.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Resistance to taxane-based therapy in breast cancer patients is a major clinical problem that may be addressed through insight of the genomic alterations leading to taxane resistance in breast cancer cells. In the current study we used whole exome sequencing to discover somatic genomic alterations, evolving across evolutionary stages during the acquisition of docetaxel resistance in breast cancer cell lines.
RESULTS: Two human breast cancer in vitro models (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) of the step-wise acquisition of docetaxel resistance were developed by exposing cells to 18 gradually increasing concentrations of docetaxel. Whole exome sequencing performed at five successive stages during this process was used to identify single point mutational events, insertions/deletions and copy number alterations associated with the acquisition of docetaxel resistance. Acquired coding variation undergoing positive selection and harboring characteristics likely to be functional were further prioritized using network-based approaches. A number of genomic changes were found to be undergoing evolutionary selection, some of which were likely to be functional. Of the five stages of progression toward resistance, most resistance relevant genomic variation appeared to arise midway towards fully resistant cells corresponding to passage 31 (5 nM docetaxel) for MDA-MB-231 and passage 16 (1.2 nM docetaxel) for MCF-7, and where the cells also exhibited a period of reduced growth rate or arrest, respectively. MCF-7 cell acquired several copy number gains on chromosome 7, including ABC transporter genes, including ABCB1 and ABCB4, as well as DMTF1, CLDN12, CROT, and SRI. For MDA-MB-231 numerous copy number losses on chromosome X involving more than 30 genes was observed. Of these genes, CASK, POLA1, PRDX4, MED14 and PIGA were highly prioritized by the applied network-based gene ranking approach. At higher docetaxel concentration MCF-7 subclones exhibited a copy number loss in E2F4, and the gene encoding this important transcription factor was down-regulated in MCF-7 resistant cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study of the evolution of acquired docetaxel resistance identified several genomic changes that might explain development of docetaxel resistance. Interestingly, the most relevant resistance-associated changes appeared to originate midway through the evolution towards fully resistant cell lines. Our data suggest that no single genomic event sufficiently predicts resistance to docetaxel, but require genomic alterations affecting multiple pathways that in concert establish the final resistance stage.},

Necrosis is an irreversible inflammatory form of cell death. In contrast, autophagy is a reversible process that can contribute both to tumor cell death and survival. This review describes recent advances in understanding the regulation of autophagy and necrosis and their implications for cancer therapy. Currently available methods to measure autophagy and necrosis are highlighted. The effect of tumor cell autophagy and necrosis on host immunity is explored.

ATRT is characterized by loss of the long arm of chromosome 22 which results in loss of the hSNF5/INI-1 gene. INI1, a member of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, is important in maintenance of the mitotic spindle and cell cycle control. Overall survival in ATRT is poor with median survival around 17 months. Radiation is an effective component of therapy but is avoided in patients younger than 3 years of age due to long term neurocognitive sequelae. Most long term survivors undergo radiation therapy as a part of their upfront or salvage therapy, and there is a suggestion that sequencing the radiation earlier in therapy may improve outcome. There is no standard curative chemotherapeutic regimen, but anecdotal reports advocate the use of intensive therapy with alkylating agents, high-dose methotrexate, or therapy that includes high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue. Due to the rarity of this tumor and the lack of randomized controlled trials it has been challenging to define optimal therapy and advance treatment. Recent laboratory investigations have identified aberrant function and/or regulation of cyclin D1, aurora kinase, and insulin-like growth factor pathways in ATRT. There has been significant interest in identifying and testing therapeutic agents that target these pathways.},

NG2 is required for asymmetric segregation of EGFR to the NG2(+) progeny, which consequently activates EGFR and undergoes EGF-dependent proliferation and self-renewal. In contrast, the NG2(-) progeny differentiates. In a mouse model, decreased NG2 asymmetry coincides with premalignant, abnormal self-renewal rather than differentiation and with tumor-initiating potential. Asymmetric division of human NG2(+) cells is prevalent in non-neoplastic tissue but is decreased in oligodendrogliomas.

It has become increasingly clear that clonal evolution is not a single sequential process, but instead frequently involves simultaneous evolution of multiple subclones that co-exist because they are of similar fitness or are spatially separated. Co-evolution of subclones also occurs when they complement each other's survival advantages. Recent studies have also shown that clonal evolution is highly heterogeneous: different individual tumors of the same type may undergo very different paths of clonal evolution. New methodological advancements, including deep digital sequencing of a mixed tumor population, single cell sequencing, and the development of more sophisticated computational tools, will continue to shape and reshape the models of clonal evolution.

	abstract = {Recent tumor sequencing data suggest an urgent need to develop a methodology to directly address intratumoral heterogeneity in the design of anticancer treatment regimens. We use RNA interference to model heterogeneous tumors, and demonstrate successful validation of computational predictions for how optimized drug combinations can yield superior effects on these tumors both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, we discover here that for many such tumors knowledge of the predominant subpopulation is insufficient for determining the best drug combination. Surprisingly, in some cases, the optimal drug combination does not include drugs that would treat any particular subpopulation most effectively, challenging straightforward intuition. We confirm examples of such a case with survival studies in a murine preclinical lymphoma model. Altogether, our approach provides new insights about design principles for combination therapy in the context of intratumoral diversity, data that should inform the development of drug regimens superior for complex tumors.
Significance: This study provides the first example of how combination drug regimens, using existing chemotherapies, can be rationally designed to maximize tumor cell death, while minimizing the outgrowth of clonal subpopulations. Cancer Discov; 4(2); 166–74. ©2013 AACR.

	abstract = {A number of successful systemic therapies are available for treatment of disseminated cancers. However, tumor response is often transient, and therapy frequently fails due to emergence of resistant populations. The latter reflects the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment as well as the evolutionary capacity of cancer phenotypes to adapt to therapeutic perturbations. Although cancers are highly dynamic systems, cancer therapy is typically administered according to a fixed, linear protocol. Here we examine an adaptive therapeutic approach that evolves in response to the temporal and spatial variability of tumor microenvironment and cellular phenotype as well as therapy-induced perturbations. Initial mathematical models find that when resistant phenotypes arise in the untreated tumor, they are typically present in small numbers because they are less fit than the sensitive population. This reflects the "cost" of phenotypic resistance such as additional substrate and energy used to up-regulate xenobiotic metabolism, and therefore not available for proliferation, or the growth inhibitory nature of environments (i.e., ischemia or hypoxia) that confer resistance on phenotypically sensitive cells. Thus, in the Darwinian environment of a cancer, the fitter chemosensitive cells will ordinarily proliferate at the expense of the less fit chemoresistant cells. The models show that, if resistant populations are present before administration of therapy, treatments designed to kill maximum numbers of cancer cells remove this inhibitory effect and actually promote more rapid growth of the resistant populations. We present an alternative approach in which treatment is continuously modulated to achieve a fixed tumor population. The goal of adaptive therapy is to enforce a stable tumor burden by permitting a significant population of chemosensitive cells to survive so that they, in turn, suppress proliferation of the less fit but chemoresistant subpopulations. Computer simulations show that this strategy can result in prolonged survival that is substantially greater than that of high dose density or metronomic therapies. The feasibility of adaptive therapy is supported by in vivo experiments. [Cancer Res 2009;69(11):4894-903] Major FindingsWe present mathematical analysis of the evolutionary dynamics of tumor populations with and without therapy. Analytic solutions and numerical simulations show that, with pretreatment, therapy-resistant cancer subpopulations are present due to phenotypic or microenvironmental factors; maximum dose density chemotherapy hastens rapid expansion of resistant populations. The models predict that host survival can be maximized if "treatment-for-cure strategy" is replaced by "treatment-for-stability." Specifically, the models predict that an optimal treatment strategy will modulate therapy to maintain a stable population of chemosensitive cells that can, in turn, suppress the growth of resistant populations under normal tumor conditions (i.e., when therapy-induced toxicity is absent). In vivo experiments using OVCAR xenografts treated with carboplatin show that adaptive therapy is feasible and, in this system, can produce long-term survival.},

This analysis identified both pervasive subclonal somatic point-mutations and a small subset of predominantly clonal and homozygous mutations, which were overrepresented in the tumor suppressor genes TP53 and NF1 and in a candidate tumor suppressor gene CDK12. We also used ABSOLUTE to infer absolute allelic copy-number profiles from 3,155 diverse cancer specimens, revealing that genome-doubling events are common in human cancer, likely occur in cells that are already aneuploid, and influence pathways of tumor progression (for example, with recessive inactivation of NF1 being less common after genome doubling).

	abstract = {Resistance to the BCR-ABL inhibitor imatinib mesylate (IM) poses a major problem for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). IM resistance often results from a secondary mutation in BCR-ABL that interferes with drug binding. However, in many instances, there is no mutation in BCR-ABL, and the basis of such BCR-ABL-independent IM resistance remains to be elucidated. To gain insight into BCR-ABL-independent IM resistance mechanisms, we performed a large-scale RNA interference screen and identified IM-sensitizing genes (IMSGs) whose knockdown renders BCR-ABL(+) cells IM-resistant. In these IMSG knockdown cells, RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling is sustained after IM treatment because of up-regulation of PRKCH, which encodes the protein kinase C (PKC) family member PKCη, an activator of CRAF. PRKCH is also up-regulated in samples from CML patients with BCR-ABL-independent IM resistance. Combined treatment with IM and trametinib, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved MEK inhibitor, synergistically kills BCR-ABL(+) IMSG knockdown cells and prolongs survival in mouse models of BCR-ABL-independent IM-resistant CML. Finally, we showed that CML stem cells contain high levels of PRKCH, and this contributes to their intrinsic IM resistance. Combined treatment with IM and trametinib synergistically kills CML stem cells with negligible effect on normal hematopoietic stem cells. Collectively, our results identify a therapeutically targetable mechanism of BCR-ABL-independent IM resistance in CML and CML stem cells.},

	abstract = {Protecting biodiversity involves preserving the maximum number and abundance of species while giving special attention to species with unique genetic or morphological characteristics. In balancing different priorities, conservation policymakers may consider quantitative measures that compare diversity across ecological communities. To serve this purpose, a measure should increase or decrease with changes in community composition in a way that reflects what is valued, including species richness, evenness, and distinctness. However, counterintuitively, studies have shown that established indices, including those that emphasize average interspecies phylogenetic distance, may increase with the elimination of species. We introduce a new diversity index, the phylogenetic entropy, which generalizes in a natural way the Shannon index to incorporate species relatedness. Phylogenetic entropy favors communities in which highly distinct species are more abundant, but it does not advocate decreasing any species proportion below a community structure-dependent threshold. We contrast the behavior of multiple indices on a community of phyllostomid bats in the Selva Lacandona. The optimal genus distribution for phylogenetic entropy populates all genera in a linear relationship to their total phylogenetic distance to other genera. Two other indices favor eliminating 12 out of the 23 genera.},

	abstract = {In vitro dose-response curves for anticancer agents are useful for predicting the clinical response to chemotherapy, and models to capture the time-dependency of dose-response curves are necessary for potential clinical extrapolation. Usually, the modified Hill model is used (see Levasseur et al., Cancer Res., 58: 5749–5761, 1998), although this model is neither mechanistic nor predictive for understanding how drug and tumor cell characteristics affect the shape of the dose-response curve. A new exponential kill (EK) model is proposed to predict the shape of dose-response curves based on the cell cycle phase specificity of a drug, the cell cycle time, the duration and concentration of drug exposure at the site of action, and a scaling factor for the level of drug resistance. Explicit analytical equations are presented for predicting the ICx (the concentration required to reduce cell growth by x\%), the maximum cell kill achievable at high doses after a given duration of drug exposure, and the slope of the survival fraction versus log (concentration) plot at the ICx. Numerical solutions illustrate that there may be an optimal, finite duration of drug exposure that maximizes cell kill for a given area under the concentration versus time curve, and an analytical equation is given to calculate when such an optimal, finite duration exists.
The EK model generates sigmoidal dose-response curves, like those seen empirically and previously described by the Hill model, which eventually plateau with increasing drug concentration at levels that depend on the cell cycle specificity of the drug, the cell cycle time, and the duration of exposure to the drug. This study includes no original data. Instead, empirical results in the literature are used to test the model. Because data by Levasseur et al. (1998) was fit to the Hill model assuming the plateau in the effect versus concentration curve to be independent of exposure duration, a full test of the model is not possible using their published data. Some tests of the EK model were possible, however, showing that EK model predictions yield good fits to in vitro data published in that and in another study. In addition, combining the EK model with a pharmacokinetic model resulted in predictions that were consistent with results of clinical studies comparing etoposide given in different schedules. Further tests of the model are necessary.},

In this study, we used animal imaging and molecular expressive profiles to investigate the characteristics of the primary tumor (GBM-3) cells and recurrent tumor (S1R1) cells from different GBM patients. Procedures Bioluminescent imaging and 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were used for assessing the orthotopical tumor development of GBM cells harboring a polycistronic reporter gene system. Western blot analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to compare the molecular expressive profiles of two types of GBM cells. Results S1R1 cells exhibited apparent invasive ability compared to GBM-3 cells using in vitro invasion assay. In vivo bioluminescent imaging showed that intracranial tumors are formed by both types of GBM cells, but the bioluminescent signal was also detected in the lumbar region at late-stage tumor formed by S1R1 cells. The MRI showed that intracranial tumors formed by S1R1 cells were highly infiltrative compared to that formed by GBM-3 cells. Additionally, these two GBM types expressed different patterns of molecules associated with tumor development. Moreover, the suppressive effects of interleukine-23 (IL-23) on xenograft tumors formed by both GBM types were detected using bioluminescent imaging. Conclusion The current data suggest that the in vivo growth behaviors and therapeutic responses of the primary and recurrent human GBMs were comparable using the reporter gene imaging, and different molecular expressive profiles exist between these two GBM types.},

Recent work has provided insights into the cellular consequences of CIN and aneuploidy. Chromosome mis-segregation per se can alter the genome in many more ways than just causing the gain or loss of chromosomes.

Many studies have characterized the response of genetically identical cells to nutrient switches in homogeneous cultures; however, in nature, microbes often live in spatially structured groups such as biofilms where cells can create metabolic gradients by consuming and releasing nutrients. Consequently, cells experience different local microenvironments and vary in their phenotype. How does this phenotypic variation affect the ability of cells to cope with nutrient switches? Here, we address this question by growing dense populations of Escherichia coli in microfluidic chambers and studying a switch from glucose to acetate at the single-cell level. Before the switch, cells vary in their metabolic activity: some grow on glucose, while others cross-feed on acetate. After the switch, only few cells can resume growth after a period of lag. The probability to resume growth depends on a cells' phenotype prior to the switch: it is highest for cells cross-feeding on acetate, while it depends in a non-monotonic way on the growth rate for cells growing on glucose. Our results suggest that the strong phenotypic variation in spatially structured populations might enhance their ability to cope with fluctuating environments.},

Cancer cell density changes dramatically during the early growth of a primary tumor and during the early seeding steps of secondary tumors and has been implicated in playing an important role in regulating metastasis and drug resistance. This study reveals that the expression of MMPs is tightly regulated by local tumor cell density through the synergistic signaling mechanism of Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and Interleukin 8 (IL-8) via the JAK2/STAT3 complex. Local tumor cell density also plays a role in the responsiveness of cells to matrix metalloproteinases inhibitors (MMPI), such as Batimastat, Marimastat, Bryostatin I, and Cipemastat, where different migratory phenotypes are observed in low and high cell density conditions. Cell density-dependent MMP regulation can be directly targeted by the simultaneous inhibition of IL-6 and IL-8 receptors via Tocilizumab and Reparixin to significantly decrease the expression of MMPs in mouse xenograft models and decrease effective metastasis. This study reveals a new strategy to decrease MMP expression through pharmacological intervention of the cognate receptors of IL-6 and IL-8 to decrease metastatic capacity of tumor cells.},

	abstract = {Intratumoral hypoxia is an independent indicator of poor patient outcome and increasing evidence supports a role for hypoxia in the development of metastatic disease. Studies suggest that the acquisition of the metastatic phenotype is not simply the result of dysregulated signal transduction pathways, but instead is achieved through a stepwise selection process driven by hypoxia. Hypoxia facilitates disruption of tissue integrity through repression of E-cadherin expression, with concomitant gain of N-cadherin expression which allows cells to escape anoikis. Through upregulation of urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) expression, hypoxia enhances proteolytic activity at the invasive front and alters the interactions between integrins and components of the extracellular matrix, thereby enabling cellular invasion through the basement membrane and the underlying stroma. Cell motility is increased through hypoxia-induced hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-MET receptor signaling, resulting in cell migration towards the blood or lymphatic microcirculation. Hypoxia-induced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) activity also plays a critical role in the dynamic tumor-stromal interactions required for the subsequent stages of metastasis. VEGF promotes angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in the primary tumor, providing the necessary routes for dissemination. VEGF-induced changes in vascular integrity and permeability promote both intravasation and extravasation, while VEGF-induced angiogenesis in the secondary tissue is essential for cell proliferation and establishment of metastatic lesions. Through regulation of these critical molecular targets, hypoxia promotes each step of the metastatic cascade and selects tumor cell populations that are able to escape the unfavorable microenvironment of the primary tumor.},

	abstract = {Aneuploidy, an abnormal chromosome content that commonly occurs because of errors in chromosome segregation, can promote or suppress tumor formation. What determines how aneuploidy influences tumorigenesis has remained unclear. Here we show that the rate of chromosome missegregation, rather than the level of accumulated aneuploidy, determines the effect on tumors. Increasing the rate of chromosome missegregation beyond a certain threshold suppresses tumors by causing cell death. Increasing errors of chromosome segregation did not affect tumor formation caused by genetic mutations that do not themselves alter chromosome inheritance. These results suggest that accelerating chromosome missegregation in chromosomally unstable tumors may be a useful strategy therapeutically., Aneuploidy, a chromosome content other than a multiple of the haploid number, is a common feature of cancer cells. Whole chromosomal aneuploidy accompanying ongoing chromosomal instability in mice resulting from reduced levels of the centromere-linked motor protein CENP-E has been reported to increase the incidence of spleen and lung tumors, but to suppress tumors in three other contexts. Exacerbating chromosome missegregation in CENP-E+/− mice by reducing levels of another mitotic checkpoint component, Mad2, is now shown to result in elevated cell death and decreased tumor formation compared with reduction of either protein alone. Furthermore, we determine that the additional contexts in which increased whole-chromosome missegregation resulting from reduced CENP-E suppresses tumor formation have a preexisting, elevated basal level of chromosome missegregation that is exacerbated by reduction of CENP-E. Tumors arising from primary causes that do not generate chromosomal instability, including loss of the INK4a tumor suppressor and microsatellite instability from reduction of the DNA mismatch repair protein MLH1, are unaffected by CENP-E–dependent chromosome missegregation. These findings support a model in which low rates of chromosome missegregation can promote tumorigenesis, whereas missegregation of high numbers of chromosomes leads to cell death and tumor suppression.},

	abstract = {Background
The dichotomy between glioblastoma cell migration and proliferation is regulated by various parameters including oxygen tension. In glioblastoma stem-like cells, hypoxia induces downregulation of pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) enzymes and a flux shift towards glycolysis. We investigated whether the 2 parallel glucose metabolic pathways are intrinsically linked with cell function and whether these pathways are mechanistically involved in regulating functional programs.

Methods
Enzyme expression, migration, and proliferation under hypoxia were studied in multiple cell types. Rapidly and slowly dividing or migrating glioblastoma cells were separated, and enzyme profiles were compared. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and Aldolase C (ALDOC), the most strongly inversely regulated PPP and glycolysis enzymes, were knocked down by short hairpin RNA.

Results
Hypoxia caused downregulation of PPP enzymes and upregulation of glycolysis enzymes in a broad spectrum of cancer and nonneoplastic cells and consistently stimulated migration while reducing proliferation. PPP enzyme expression was increased in rapidly dividing glioblastoma cells, whereas glycolysis enzymes were decreased. Conversely, glycolysis enzymes were elevated in migrating cells, whereas PPP enzymes were diminished. Knockdown of G6PD reduced glioblastoma cell proliferation, whereas ALDOC knockdown decreased migration. Enzyme inhibitors had similar effects. G6PD knockdown in a highly proliferative but noninvasive glioblastoma cell line resulted in prolonged survival of mice with intracerebral xenografts, whereas ALDOC knockdown shortened survival. In a highly invasive glioblastoma xenograft model, tumor burden was unchanged by either knockdown.

Conclusions
Cell function and metabolic state are coupled independently of hypoxia, and glucose metabolic pathways are causatively involved in regulating “go or grow” cellular programs.},

	abstract = {Living species, ranging from bacteria to animals, exist in environmental conditions that exhibit spatial and temporal heterogeneity which requires them to adapt. Risk-spreading through spontaneous phenotypic variations is a known concept in ecology, which is used to explain how species may survive when faced with the evolutionary risks associated with temporally varying environments. In order to support a deeper understanding of the adaptive role of spontaneous phenotypic variations in fluctuating environments, we consider a system of non-local partial differential equations modelling the evolutionary dynamics of two competing phenotype-structured populations in the presence of periodically oscillating nutrient levels. The two populations undergo spontaneous phenotypic variations at different rates. The phenotypic state of each individual is represented by a continuous variable, and the phenotypic landscape of the populations evolves in time due to variations in the nutrient level. Exploiting the analytical tractability of our model, we study the long-time behaviour of the solutions to obtain a detailed mathematical depiction of evolutionary dynamics. The results suggest that when nutrient levels undergo small and slow oscillations, it is evolutionarily more convenient to rarely undergo spontaneous phenotypic variations. Conversely, under relatively large and fast periodic oscillations in the nutrient levels, which bring about alternating cycles of starvation and nutrient abundance, higher rates of spontaneous phenotypic variations confer a competitive advantage. We discuss the implications of our results in the context of cancer metabolism.},

We attempt to model the dynamics of the game both in the continuous case, with a system of non-linear first-order differential equations, and in the discrete case, with a system of non-linear difference equations. Using this model, we look at the notions of stability and asymptotic behavior. Our notion of stable equilibrium for the continuous dynamic includes, but is somewhat more general than, the notion of ESS.},

However, the clinical activity of NAMPT inhibitors has proven limited, suggesting that alternative NAD+ production routes exploited by tumors confer resistance. Here, we show the gene encoding nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT), a second NAD+-producing enzyme, is amplified and overexpressed in a subset of common types of cancer, including ovarian cancer, where NAPRT expression correlates with a BRCAness gene expression signature. Both NAPRT and NAMPT increased intracellular NAD+ levels. NAPRT silencing reduced energy status, protein synthesis, and cell size in ovarian and pancreatic cancer cells. NAPRT silencing sensitized cells to NAMPT inhibitors both in vitro and in vivo; similar results were obtained with the NAPRT inhibitor 2-hydroxynicotinic acid. Reducing NAPRT levels in a BRCA2-deficient cancer cell line exacerbated DNA damage in response to chemotherapeutics. In conclusion, NAPRT-dependent NAD+ biosynthesis contributes to cell metabolism and to the DNA repair process in a subset of tumors.

Following the introduction of undergraduate and graduate programs in mathematical biology, we have begun to see curricula developing with speciﬁc and exclusive focus on mathematical oncology. In 2018, 218 articles on mathematical modeling of cancer were published in various journals, including not only traditional modeling journals like the Bulletin of Mathematical Biology and the Journal of Theoretical Biology, but also publications in renowned science, biology, and cancer journals with tremendous impact in the cancer ﬁeld (Cell, Cancer Research, Clinical Cancer Research, Cancer Discovery, Scientiﬁc Reports, PNAS, PLoS Biology, Nature Communications, eLife, etc). This shows the breadth of cancer models that are being developed for multiple purposes. While some models are phenomenological in nature following a bottom-up approach, other models are more top-down data-driven. Here, we discuss the emerging trend in mathematical oncology publications to predict novel, optimal, sometimes even patient-speciﬁc treatments, and propose a convention when to use a model to predict novel treatments and, probably more importantly, when not to.},

	abstract = {Knockout serum replacement (KOSR) is a nutrient supplement commonly used to replace serum for culturing stem cells. We show here that KOSR has pro-survival activity in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells transformed by the BCR-ABL oncogene. Inhibitors of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase kill CML cells by stimulating pro-apoptotic BIM and inhibiting anti-apoptotic BCL2, BCLxL and MCL1. We found that KOSR protects CML cells from killing by BCR-ABL inhibitors-imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib. The protective effect of KOSR is reversible and not due to the selective outgrowth of drug-resistant clones. In KOSR-protected CML cells, imatinib still inhibited the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, reduced the phosphorylation of STAT, ERK and AKT, down-regulated BCL2, BCLxL, MCL1 and up-regulated BIM. However, these pro-apoptotic alterations failed to cause cytochrome c release from the mitochondria. With mitochondria isolated from KOSR-cultured CML cells, we showed that addition of recombinant BIM protein also failed to cause cytochrome c release. Besides the kinase inhibitors, KOSR could protect cells from menadione, an inducer of oxidative stress, but it did not protect cells from DNA damaging agents. Switching from serum to KOSR caused a transient increase in reactive oxygen species and AKT phosphorylation in CML cells that were protected by KOSR but not in those that were not protected by this nutrient supplement. Treatment of KOSR-cultured cells with the PH-domain inhibitor MK2206 blocked AKT phosphorylation, abrogated the formation of BIM-resistant mitochondria and stimulated cell death. These results show that KOSR has cell-context dependent pro-survival activity that is linked to AKT activation and the inhibition of BIM-induced cytochrome c release from the mitochondria.},

In this study, we evaluated the antitumor activity of and the mechanisms underlying acquired resistance to two potent selective FGFR inhibitors, AZD4547 and BAY116387, in LC cell lines. The antitumor activity of AZD4547 and BAY1163877 was screened in 24 LC cell lines, including 5 with FGFR1 amplification. Two cell lines containing FGFR1 amplifications, H1581 and DMS114, were sensitive to FGFR inhibitors (IC50{\textless}250 nm). Clones of FGFR1-amplified H1581 cells resistant to AZD4547 or BAY116387 (H1581AR and H1581BR cells, respectively) were established. Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) array and immunoblotting analyses showed strong overexpression and activation of Met in H1581AR/BR cells, compared with that in the parental cells. Gene set enrichment analysis against the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database showed that cytokine–cytokine receptor interaction pathways were significantly enriched in H1581AR/BR cells, with Met contributing significantly to the core enrichment. Genomic DNA quantitative PCR and fluorescent in situ hybridization analyses showed MET amplification in H1581AR, but not in H1581BR, cells. Met amplification drives acquired resistance to AZD4547 in H1581AR cells by activating ErbB3. Combination treatment with FGFR inhibitors and an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)/Met inhibitor, crizotinib, or Met-specific short interfering RNA (siRNA) synergistically inhibited cell proliferation in both H1581AR and H1581BR cells. Conversely, ectopic expression of Met in H1581 cells conferred resistance to AZD4547 and BAY1163877. Acquired resistance to FGFR inhibitors not only altered cellular morphology, but also promoted migration and invasion of resistant clones, in part by inducing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Taken together, our data suggest that Met activation is sufficient to bypass dependency on FGFR signaling. Concurrent inhibition of the Met and FGFR pathways may have synergistic clinical benefits when targeting FGFR-dependent LC.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Squamous cell lung cancers (SQCLC) account for 25\% of all NSCLCs, yet the prognosis of these patients is poor and treatment options are limited. Amplified FGFR1 is one of the most common oncogenic events in SQCLCs, occurring in approximately 20\% of cases. AZD4547 is a potent and selective FGFR1-3 inhibitor with antitumor activity in FGFR1-amplified SQCLC cell lines and patient-derived xenografts.
Experimental Design: On the basis of these data, we performed a phase I study of AZD4547 in patients with previously treated stage IV FGFR1-amplified SQCLCs (NCT00979134). FGFR1 amplification (FGFR1:CEP8 ≥ 2) was determined by FISH. The primary endpoint was safety/tolerability. Secondary endpoints included antitumor activity, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and molecular analyses.
Results: Fifteen FGFR1-amplified patients were treated. The most common related adverse events (AE) were gastrointestinal and dermatologic. Grade ≥3–related AEs occurred in 3 patients (23\%). Thirteen patients were evaluable for radiographic response assessment. The overall response rate was 8\% (1 PR). Two of 15 patients (13.3\%) were progression-free at 12 weeks, and the median overall survival was 4.9 months. Molecular tests, including next-generation sequencing, gene expression analysis, and FGFR1 immunohistochemistry, showed poor correlation between gene amplification and expression, potential genomic modifiers of efficacy, and heterogeneity in 8p11 amplicon.
Conclusions: AZD4547 was tolerable at a dosage of 80 mg oral twice a day, with modest antitumor activity. Detailed molecular studies show that these tumors are heterogeneous, with a range of mutational covariates and stark differences in gene expression of the 8p11 amplicon that likely explain the modest efficacy of FGFR inhibition in this disease.

We explored the role of FGFR2 amplification in gastric cancer and the therapeutic potential of AZD4547, a potent and selective ATP-competitive receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor of fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)1–3, in patients with FGFR2-amplified gastric cancer.
Experimental Design: Array-comparative genomic hybridization and FISH were used to identify FGFR2 amplification in gastric cancer patient tumor samples. The effects of FGFR2 modulation were investigated in gastric cancer cells with FGFR2 amplification and in patient-derived gastric cancer xenograft (PDGCX) models using two approaches: inhibition with AZD4547 and short hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown of FGFR2.
Results: Amplification of the FGFR2 gene was identified in a subset of Chinese and Caucasian patients with gastric cancer. Gastric cancer cell lines SNU-16 and KATOIII, carrying the amplified FGFR2 gene, were extremely sensitive to AZD4547 in vitro with GI50 values of 3 and 5 nmol/L, respectively. AZD4547 effectively inhibited phosphorylation of FGFR2 and its downstream signaling molecules and induced apoptosis in SNU-16 cells. Furthermore, inhibition of FGFR2 signaling by AZD4547 resulted in significant dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition in FGFR2-amplified xenograft (SNU-16) and PDGCX models (SGC083) but not in nonamplified models. shRNA knockdown of FGFR2 similarly inhibited tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Finally, compared with monotherapy, we showed enhancement of in vivo antitumor efficacy using AZD4547 in combination with chemotherapeutic agents.
Conclusion: FGFR2 pathway activation is required for driving growth and survival of gastric cancer carrying FGFR2 gene amplification both in vitro and in vivo. Our data support therapeutic intervention with FGFR inhibitors, such as AZD4547, in patients with gastric cancer carrying FGFR2 gene amplification. Clin Cancer Res; 19(9); 2572–83. ©2013 AACR.},

	abstract = {Some gastric cancers have FGFR2 amplifications, making them sensitive to FGFR inhibitors. However, cancer cells inevitably develop resistance despite initial response. The underlying resistance mechanism to FGFR inhibition is unclear. In this study, we applied a kinome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen to systematically identify kinases that are determinants of sensitivity to a potent FGFR inhibitor AZD4547 in KatoIII cells, a gastric cancer cell line with FGFR2 amplification. In total, we identified 20 kinases, involved in ILK, SRC, and EGFR signaling pathways, as determinants that alter cell sensitivity to FGFR inhibition. We functionally validated the top negatively selected and positively selected kinases, ILK and CSK, from the CRISPR/Cas9 screen using RNA interference. We observed synergistic effects on KatoIII cells as well as three additional gastric cancer cell lines with FGFR2 amplification when AZD4547 was combined with small molecular inhibitors Cpd22 and lapatinib targeting ILK and EGFR/HER2, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrated that GSK3b is one of the downstream effectors of ILK upon FGFR inhibition. In summary, our study systematically evaluated the kinases and associated signaling pathways modulating cell response to FGFR inhibition, and for the first time, demonstrated that targeting ILK would enhance the effectiveness of AZD4547 treatment of gastric tumors with amplifications of FGFR2.},

	abstract = {Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2)-targeted therapy has attracted considerable attention as novel anticancer agents in gastric cancer (GC). However, intrinsic or acquired drug resistance has emerged as a major challenge to their clinical use. In this study, we demonstrated that several receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), including EGFR, HER3 and MET, activations contributed to AZD4547 (a selective FGFR2 inhibitor) hyposensitivity in FGFR2 amplified GC cells. The rescue effect was abrogated by inhibiting these RTKs with their targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). In addition, synergy in growth inhibition was observed when the GC cells were treated with a combination of AZD4547 and cetuximab (an EGFR monoclonal antibody) both in vitro and in vivo. More importantly, tissue microarray analysis revealed that these resistance-conferring RTKs were highly expressed in FGFR2 positive GC patients. Taken together, these observations demonstrated RTKs including EGFR, HER3 and MET activations as novel mechanisms of hyposensitivity to AZD4547. It will be clinically valuable to investigate the involvement of RTK-mediated signaling in intrinsicor acquired resistance to FGFR2 TKIs in GC. A combination targeted therapeutic strategy may be recommended for treating FGFR2 amplified GC patients with these RTK activations.},

Here, we report the molecular basis for acquired resistance to BGJ398 in three patients via integrative genomic characterization of cell-free circulating tumor DNA (cfDNA), primary tumors, and metastases. Serial analysis of cfDNA demonstrated multiple recurrent point mutations in the FGFR2 kinase domain at progression. Accordingly, biopsy of post-progression lesions and rapid autopsy revealed marked inter- and intra-lesional heterogeneity, with different FGFR2 mutations in individual resistant clones. Molecular modeling and in vitro studies indicated that each mutation lead to BGJ398 resistance and was surmountable by structurally distinct FGFR inhibitors.

Although tumor progression has traditionally been viewed as a gradual stepwise process, recent studies suggest that evolutionary rates in tumors can be variable with periods of punctuated mutational bursts and relative stasis. For example, Big Bang dynamics have been reported, wherein after transformation, growth occurs in the absence of stringent selection, consistent with effectively neutral evolution. Although first noted in colorectal tumors, effective neutrality may be relatively common. Additionally, punctuated evolution resulting from mutational bursts and cataclysmic genomic alterations have been described. In this review, we contrast these findings with the conventional gradualist view of clonal evolution and describe potential clinical and therapeutic implications of different evolutionary modes and tempos.},

	abstract = {Background: Approximately 5\%-10\% of gastric cancers have a fibroblast growth factor receptor-2 (FGFR2) gene amplification. AZD4547 is a selective FGFR-1, 2, 3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor with potent preclinical activity in FGFR2 amplified gastric adenocarcinoma SNU16 and SGC083 xenograft models. The randomized phase II SHINE study (NCT01457846) investigated whether AZD4547 improves clinical outcome versus paclitaxel as second-line treatment in patients with advanced gastric adenocarcinoma displaying FGFR2 polysomy or gene amplification detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
Patients and methods: Patients were randomized 3:2 (FGFR2 gene amplification) or 1:1 (FGFR2 polysomy) to AZD4547 or paclitaxel. Patients received AZD4547 80 mg twice daily, orally, on a 2 weeks on/1 week off schedule of a 21-day cycle or intravenous paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 administered weekly on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Safety outcomes were assessed and an exploratory biomarker analysis was undertaken.
Results: Of 71 patients randomized (AZD4547 n = 41, paclitaxel n = 30), 67 received study treatment (AZD4547 n = 40, paclitaxel n = 27). Among all randomized patients, median PFS was 1.8 months with AZD4547 and 3.5 months with paclitaxel (one-sided P = 0.9581); median follow-up duration for PFS was 1.77 and 2.12 months, respectively. The incidence of adverse events was similar in both treatment arms. Exploratory biomarker analyses revealed marked intratumor heterogeneity of FGFR2 amplification and poor concordance between amplification/polysomy and FGFR2 mRNA expression.
Conclusions: AZD4547 did not significantly improve PFS versus paclitaxel in gastric cancer FGFR2 amplification/polysomy patients. Considerable intratumor heterogeneity for FGFR2 gene amplification and poor concordance between FGFR2 amplification/polysomy and FGFR2 expression indicates the need for alternative predictive biomarker testing.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Copy-number aberrations (CNAs) and whole-genome duplications (WGDs) are frequent somatic mutations in cancer. Accurate quantification of these mutations from DNA sequencing of bulk tumor samples is complicated by varying tumor purity, admixture of multiple tumor clones with distinct mutations, and high aneuploidy. Standard methods for CNA inference analyze tumor samples individually, but recently DNA sequencing of multiple samples from a cancer patient - e.g. from multiple regions of a primary tumor, matched primary/metastases, or multiple time points - has become common. We introduce a new algorithm, Holistic Allele-specific Tumor Copy-number Heterogeneity (HATCHet), that infers allele and clone-specific CNAs and WGDs jointly across multiple tumor samples from the same patient, and that leverages the relationships between clones in these samples. HATCHet provides a fresh perspective on CNA inference and includes several algorithmic innovations that overcome the limitations of existing methods, resulting in a more robust approach even for single-sample analysis. We also develop MASCoTE (Multiple Allele-specific Simulation of Copy-number Tumor Evolution), a framework for generating realistic simulated multi-sample DNA sequencing data with appropriate corrections for the differences in genome lengths between the normal and tumor clone(s) present in mixed samples. HATCHet outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on 256 simulated tumor samples from 64 patients, half with WGD. HATCHet9s analysis of 49 primary tumor and metastasis samples from 10 prostate cancer patients reveals subclonal CNAs in only 29 of these samples, compared to the published reports of extensive subclonal CNAs in all samples. HATCHet9s inferred CNAs are also more consistent with the reports of polyclonal origin and limited heterogeneity of metastasis in a subset of patients. HATCHet9s analysis of 35 primary tumor and metastasis samples from 4 pancreas cancer patients reveals subclonal CNAs in 20 samples, WGDs in 3 patients, and tumor subclones that are shared across primary and metastases samples from the same patient - none of which were described in published analysis of this data. HATCHet substantially improves the analysis of CNAs and WGDs, leading to more reliable studies of tumor evolution in primary tumors and metastases.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: BRCA1/2-mutated and some sporadic triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) have DNA repair defects and are sensitive to DNA-damaging therapeutics. Recently, three independent DNA-based measures of genomic instability were developed on the basis of loss of heterozygosity (LOH), telomeric allelic imbalance (TAI), and large-scale state transitions (LST).
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We assessed a combined homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) score, an unweighted sum of LOH, TAI, and LST scores, in three neoadjuvant TNBC trials of platinum-containing therapy. We then tested the association of HR deficiency, defined as HRD score ≥42 or BRCA1/2 mutation, with response to platinum-based therapy.
RESULTS: In a trial of neoadjuvant platinum, gemcitabine, and iniparib, HR deficiency predicted residual cancer burden score of 0 or I (RCB 0/I) and pathologic complete response (pCR; OR = 4.96, P = 0.0036; OR = 6.52, P = 0.0058). HR deficiency remained a significant predictor of RCB 0/I when adjusted for clinical variables (OR = 5.86, P = 0.012). In two other trials of neoadjuvant cisplatin therapy, HR deficiency predicted RCB 0/I and pCR (OR = 10.18, P = 0.0011; OR = 17.00, P = 0.0066). In a multivariable model of RCB 0/I, HR deficiency retained significance when clinical variables were included (OR = 12.08, P = 0.0017). When restricted to BRCA1/2 nonmutated tumors, response was higher in patients with high HRD scores: RCB 0/I P = 0.062, pCR P = 0.063 in the neoadjuvant platinum, gemcitabine, and iniparib trial; RCB 0/I P = 0.0039, pCR P = 0.018 in the neoadjuvant cisplatin trials.

	abstract = {DNA repair competency is one determinant of sensitivity to certain chemotherapy drugs, such as cisplatin. Cancer cells with intact DNA repair can avoid the accumulation of genome damage during growth and also can repair platinum-induced DNA damage. We sought genomic signatures indicative of defective DNA repair in cell lines and tumors and correlated these signatures to platinum sensitivity. The number of subchromosomal regions with allelic imbalance extending to the telomere (N(tAI)) predicted cisplatin sensitivity in vitro and pathologic response to preoperative cisplatin treatment in patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In serous ovarian cancer treated with platinum-based chemotherapy, higher levels of N(tAI) forecast a better initial response. We found an inverse relationship between BRCA1 expression and N(tAI) in sporadic TNBC and serous ovarian cancers without BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. Thus, accumulation of telomeric allelic imbalance is a marker of platinum sensitivity and suggests impaired DNA repair.
SIGNIFICANCE: Mutations in BRCA genes cause defects in DNA repair that predict sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, including platinum; however, some patients without BRCA mutations also benefit from these agents. NtAI, a genomic measure of unfaithfully repaired DNA, may identify cancer patients likely to benefit from treatments targeting defective DNA repair.},

To characterize the microenvironment and niche signaling, we used single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) to determine the transcriptomes of 4,391 individual cells. Based on specific markers, we identified epithelial cells, fibroblasts and macrophages in initial tissue explants during organoid formation. The majority of macrophages were polarized towards wound healing and tumor promotion M2-type. During the course of time, the organoids maintained both epithelial and fibroblast lineages with the features of immature mouse gastric stomach. We detected a subset of cells in both lineages expressing Lgr5, one of the stem cell markers. We examined the lineage-specific Wnt signaling activation, and identified that Rspo3 was specifically expressed in the fibroblast lineage, providing an endogenous source of the R-spondin to activate Wnt signaling.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Bacteria often live in spatially structured groups such as biofilms. In these groups, cells can collectively generate gradients through the uptake and release of compounds. In turn, individual cells adapt their activities to the environment shaped by the whole group. Here we studied how these processes can generate phenotypic variation in clonal populations and how this variation contributes to the resilience of the population to antibiotics. We grew two-dimensional populations of Escherichia coli in microfluidic chambers where limiting amounts of glucose were supplied from one side. We found that the collective metabolic activity of cells created microscale gradients where nutrient concentration varied over a few cell lengths. As a result, growth rates and gene expression levels varied strongly between cells close in space. Furthermore, we found evidence for a metabolic cross-feeding interaction between glucose fermenting and acetate respiring subpopulations. Finally, we found that the populations were able to survive an antibiotic pulse that was lethal in well-mixed conditions, likely due to the presence of a slow growing subpopulation. Our work shows that emergent metabolic gradients can have important consequences for the functionality of bacterial populations as they create opportunities for metabolic interactions and increase the populations tolerance to environmental stressors.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

While cancer cell populations typically display distinctive equilibria in the proportion of cells in various states, the mechanisms by which this occurs are poorly understood. Here, we study the dynamics of phenotypic proportions in human breast cancer cell lines. We show that subpopulations of cells purified for a given phenotypic state return towards equilibrium proportions over time. These observations can be explained by a Markov model in which cells transition stochastically between states. A prediction of this model is that, given certain conditions, any subpopulation of cells will return to equilibrium phenotypic proportions over time. A second prediction is that breast cancer stem-like cells arise de novo from non-stem-like cells. These findings contribute to our understanding of cancer heterogeneity and reveal how stochasticity in single-cell behaviors promotes phenotypic equilibrium in populations of cancer cells.},

Of ultimate importance is the question what are the mechanisms that trigger the progression from benign neoplasms (uncontrolled/autonomous proliferation) to malignant invasive tumours (high migration). In the following, we challenge the currently prevailing view that the emergence of invasiveness is mainly the consequence of acquired cancer cell mutations. To study this, we mainly focus on the 'glioblastoma multiforme' (GBM) tumour which is a particularly aggressive and invasive tumour. In particular, with the help of a simple growth model, we demonstrate that the short time required for the recurrence of a GBM tumour after a gross total resection cannot be deduced solely from a mutation-based theory. We propose that the transition to invasive tumour phenotypes can be explained on the basis of the microscopic 'Go or Grow' mechanism (migration/proliferation dichotomy) and the oxygen shortage, i.e. hypoxia, in the environment of a growing tumour. We test this hypothesis with the help of a lattice-gas cellular automaton. Finally, we suggest possible therapies that could help prevent the progression towards malignancy and invasiveness of benign tumours.},

For example, some evolutionary mechanics lead to amplification of selection in structured populations, while others suppress it. Here, we use computer simulations to study evolutionary populations moved by flows, and show how the speed of this motion impacts the fixation probability of an invading mutant. Flows of different speeds interpolate between evolutionary dynamics on fixed heterogeneous graphs and in well-stirred populations. We find that the motion has an active role in amplifying or suppressing selection, accomplished by fragmenting and reconnecting the interaction graph. While increasing flow speeds suppress selection for most evolutionary models, we identify characteristic responses to flow for the different update rules we test. We suggest these responses as a potential aid for choosing the most suitable update rule for a given biological system.},

Glioblastoma is the most lethal form of human brain cancer. The genomic alterations and gene expression profiles characterizing this tumor type have been widely studied. Puchalski et al. created the Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas, a freely available online resource for the research community. The atlas, a collaborative effort between bioinformaticians and pathologists, maps molecular features of glioblastomas, such as transcriptional signatures, to histologically defined anatomical regions of the tumors. The relationships identified in this atlas, in conjunction with associated databases of clinical and genomic information, could provide new insights into the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of glioblastoma.

Glioblastoma is an aggressive brain tumor that carries a poor prognosis. The tumor’s molecular and cellular landscapes are complex, and their relationships to histologic features routinely used for diagnosis are unclear. We present the Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas, an anatomically based transcriptional atlas of human glioblastoma that aligns individual histologic features with genomic alterations and gene expression patterns, thus assigning molecular information to the most important morphologic hallmarks of the tumor. The atlas and its clinical and genomic database are freely accessible online data resources that will serve as a valuable platform for future investigations of glioblastoma pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment.

	abstract = {Brain tumors’ battle of the sexes
In recent years, there has been increasing interest in personalized medicine for cancer, considering the unique biology of each tumor and patient to optimize therapeutic approaches. Sex differences play a role in patient outcomes, and Yang et al. determined that in the case of the brain tumor glioblastoma, these go beyond hormonal influences and appear to be intrinsic to the tumor cells themselves. The authors found that the sex of the patient correlates not only with prognosis but also with responses to different treatments, suggesting that it may be an important factor to consider when optimizing the therapeutic regimen for each patient.
Sex differences in the incidence and outcome of human disease are broadly recognized but, in most cases, not sufficiently understood to enable sex-specific approaches to treatment. Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common malignant brain tumor, provides a case in point. Despite well-established differences in incidence and emerging indications of differences in outcome, there are few insights that distinguish male and female GBM at the molecular level or allow specific targeting of these biological differences. Here, using a quantitative imaging–based measure of response, we found that standard therapy is more effective in female compared with male patients with GBM. We then applied a computational algorithm to linked GBM transcriptome and outcome data and identified sex-specific molecular subtypes of GBM in which cell cycle and integrin signaling are the critical determinants of survival for male and female patients, respectively. The clinical relevance of cell cycle and integrin signaling pathway signatures was further established through correlations between gene expression and in vitro chemotherapy sensitivity in a panel of male and female patient-derived GBM cell lines. Together, these results suggest that greater precision in GBM molecular subtyping can be achieved through sex-specific analyses and that improved outcomes for all patients might be accomplished by tailoring treatment to sex differences in molecular mechanisms.
Male and female glioblastomas are biologically distinct, and improving outcomes may require sex-specific approaches to treatment.

UR domains originate from a subset of late-replicating heterochromatic regions containing gene deserts and genes involved in cell adhesion and neurogenesis. While lineage-specific CNVs have been identified in mammalian cells, classically in the immune system where V(D)J recombination occurs, we demonstrate that CNVs form during gestation in the placenta by an underreplication mechanism, not by recombination nor deletion. Our results reveal that large scale CNVs are a normal feature of the mammalian placental genome, which are regulated systematically during embryogenesis and are propagated by a mechanism of underreplication.},

We examined how the immune microenvironment molds tumor evolution at different metastatic organs in a longitudinal dataset of colorectal cancer. Through multiplexed analyses, we showed that clonal evolution patterns during metastatic progression depend on the immune contexture at the metastatic site. Genetic evidence of neoantigen depletion was observed in the sites with high Immunoscore and spatial proximity between Ki67+ tumor cells and CD3+ cells. The immunoedited tumor clones were eliminated and did not recur, while progressing clones were immune privileged, despite the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Characterization of immune-privileged metastases revealed tumor-intrinsic and tumor-extrinsic mechanisms of escape. The lowest recurrence risk was associated with high Immunoscore, occurrence of immunoediting, and low tumor burden. We propose a parallel selection model of metastatic progression, where branched evolution could be traced back to immune-escaping clones. The findings could inform the understanding of cancer dissemination and the development of immunotherapeutics.},

The development of TGCs is complex and requires transition from the mitotic to the endoreduplication cell cycle and is regulated by a wide variety of factors. During early gestation, TGCs mediate blastocyst attachment and invasion into the uterine epithelium, regulate uterus decidualization, and anatomosis with maternal blood spaces to form the transient yolk sac placenta. During later gestation, TGCs secrete a wide array of hormones and paracrine factors, including steroid hormones and Prolactin-related cytokines, to target the maternal physiological systems for proper maternal adaptations to pregnancy and the fetal-maternal interface to ensure vasculature remodeling. The large number of mouse mutants with defects in TGC development and function are giving us significant new insights into the biology of these fascinating cells.},

	abstract = {Variable tumor cellularity can limit sensitivity and precision in comparative genomics, because differences in tumor content can result in misclassifying truncal mutations as region-specific private mutations in stroma-rich regions, especially when studying tissue specimens of mediocre tumor cellularity such as lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs). To address this issue, we refined a nuclei flow-sorting approach by sorting nuclei based on ploidy and the LUAD lineage marker thyroid transcription factor 1 and applied this method to investigated genome-wide somatic copy number aberrations (SCNA) and mutations of 409 cancer genes in 39 tumor populations obtained from 16 primary tumors and 21 matched metastases. This approach increased the mean tumor purity from 54\% (range: 7-89\%) of unsorted material to 92\% (range: 79-99\%) after sorting. Despite this rise in tumor purity, we detected limited genetic heterogeneity between primary tumors and their metastases. In fact, 88\% of SCNAs and 80\% of mutations were propagated from primary tumors to metastases and low allele frequency mutations accounted for much of the mutational heterogeneity. Even though the presence of SCNAs indicated a history of chromosomal instability (CIN) in all tumors, metastases did not have more SCNAs than primary tumors. Moreover, tumors with biallelic TP53 or ATM mutations had high numbers of SCNAs, yet they were associated with a low interlesional genetic heterogeneity. The results of our study thus provide evidence that most macroevolutionary events occur in primary tumors before metastatic dissemination and advocate for a limited degree of CIN over time and space in this cohort of LUADs. Sampling of primary tumors thus may suffice to detect most mutations and SCNAs. In addition, metastases but not primary tumors had seeded additional metastases in three of four patients; this provides a genomic rational for surgical treatment of such oligometastatic LUADs.},

	abstract = {Visual inspection of histopathology slides is one of the main methods used by pathologists to assess the stage, type and subtype of lung tumors. Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) are the most prevalent subtypes of lung cancer, and their distinction requires visual inspection by an experienced pathologist. In this study, we trained a deep convolutional neural network (inception v3) on whole-slide images obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas to accurately and automatically classify them into LUAD, LUSC or normal lung tissue. The performance of our method is comparable to that of pathologists, with an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.97. Our model was validated on independent datasets of frozen tissues, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues and biopsies. Furthermore, we trained the network to predict the ten most commonly mutated genes in LUAD. We found that six of them-STK11, EGFR, FAT1, SETBP1, KRAS and TP53-can be predicted from pathology images, with AUCs from 0.733 to 0.856 as measured on a held-out population. These findings suggest that deep-learning models can assist pathologists in the detection of cancer subtype or gene mutations. Our approach can be applied to any cancer type, and the code is available at https://github.com/ncoudray/DeepPATH .},

	abstract = {We used spectral karyotyping to provide a detailed analysis of karyotypic aberrations in the diverse group of cancer cell lines established by the National Cancer Institute for the purpose of anticancer drug discovery. Along with the karyotypic description of these cell lines we defined and studied karyotypic complexity and heterogeneity (metaphase-to-metaphase variations) based on three separate components of genomic anatomy: (a) ploidy; (b) numerical changes; and (c) structural rearrangements. A wide variation in these parameters was evident in these cell lines, and different association patterns between them were revealed. Analysis of the breakpoints and other specific features of chromosomal changes across the entire set of cell lines or within particular lineages pointed to a striking lability of centromeric regions that distinguishes the epithelial tumor cell lines. We have also found that balanced translocations are as frequent in absolute number within the cell lines derived from solid as from hematopoietic tumors. Important similarities were noticed between karyotypic changes in cancer cell lines and that seen in primary tumors. This dataset offers insights into the causes and consequences of the destabilizing events and chromosomal instability that may occur during tumor development and progression. It also provides a foundation for investigating associations between structural genome anatomy and cancer molecular markers and targets, gene expression, gene dosage, and resistance or sensitivity to tens of thousands of molecular compounds.},

Although cell lines are known to evolve in culture, the extent of the resultant genetic and transcriptional heterogeneity and its functional consequences remain understudied. Here we use genomic analyses of 106 human cell lines grown in two laboratories to show extensive clonal diversity. Further comprehensive genomic characterization of 27 strains of the common breast cancer cell line MCF7 uncovered rapid genetic diversification. Similar results were obtained with multiple strains of 13 additional cell lines. Notably, genetic changes were associated with differential activation of gene expression programs and marked differences in cell morphology and proliferation. Barcoding experiments showed that cell line evolution occurs as a result of positive clonal selection that is highly sensitive to culture conditions. Analyses of single-cell-derived clones demonstrated that continuous instability quickly translates into heterogeneity of the cell line. When the 27 MCF7 strains were tested against 321 anti-cancer compounds, we uncovered considerably different drug responses: at least 75\% of compounds that strongly inhibited some strains were completely inactive in others. This study documents the extent, origins and consequences of genetic variation within cell lines, and provides a framework for researchers to measure such variation in efforts to support maximally reproducible cancer research.},

Using a systems-based approach, we predict four compounds showing high potency to reverse gene expression in liver cancer and validate that all four compounds are effective in five liver cancer cell lines. The in vivo efficacy of pyrvinium pamoate is further confirmed in a subcutaneous xenograft model. In conclusion, this systems-based approach may be complementary to the traditional target-based approach in connecting diseases to potentially efficacious drugs.},

These methods are fast and fairly accurate. However, they hardly deal with incomplete distance matrices. Such matrices are frequent with recent multi-gene studies, when two species do not share any gene in analyzed data. The few existing algorithms to infer trees with satisfying accuracy from incomplete distance matrices have time complexity in O(n4) or more, where n is the number of taxa, which precludes large scale studies. Agglomerative distance algorithms (e.g. NJ [1, 2]) are much faster, with time complexity in O(n3) which allows huge datasets and heavy bootstrap analyses to be dealt with. These algorithms proceed in three steps: (a) search for the taxon pair to be agglomerated, (b) estimate the lengths of the two so-created branches, (c) reduce the distance matrix and return to (a) until the tree is fully resolved. But available agglomerative algorithms cannot deal with incomplete matrices.},

	abstract = {Germline copy number variants (CNVs) and somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) are of significant importance in syndromic conditions and cancer. Massively parallel sequencing is increasingly used to infer copy number information from variations in the read depth in sequencing data. However, this approach has limitations in the case of targeted re-sequencing, which leaves gaps in coverage between the regions chosen for enrichment and introduces biases related to the efficiency of target capture and library preparation. We present a method for copy number detection, implemented in the software package CNVkit, that uses both the targeted reads and the nonspecifically captured off-target reads to infer copy number evenly across the genome. This combination achieves both exon-level resolution in targeted regions and sufficient resolution in the larger intronic and intergenic regions to identify copy number changes. In particular, we successfully inferred copy number at equivalent to 100-kilobase resolution genome-wide from a platform targeting as few as 293 genes. After normalizing read counts to a pooled reference, we evaluated and corrected for three sources of bias that explain most of the extraneous variability in the sequencing read depth: GC content, target footprint size and spacing, and repetitive sequences. We compared the performance of CNVkit to copy number changes identified by array comparative genomic hybridization. We packaged the components of CNVkit so that it is straightforward to use and provides visualizations, detailed reporting of significant features, and export options for integration into existing analysis pipelines.

Here, combining two large sets of high-throughput sequencing data, we delineate the entire picture of genetic alterations and affected pathways in these glioma types, with sensitive detection of driver genes. Grade II and III gliomas comprise three distinct subtypes characterized by discrete sets of mutations and distinct clinical behaviors. Mutations showed significant positive and negative correlations and a chronological hierarchy, as inferred from different allelic burdens among coexisting mutations, suggesting that there is functional interplay between the mutations that drive clonal selection. Extensive serial and multi-regional sampling analyses further supported this finding and also identified a high degree of temporal and spatial heterogeneity generated during tumor expansion and relapse, which is likely shaped by the complex but ordered processes of multiple clonal selection and evolutionary events.},

	abstract = {Spatial heterogeneity of transcriptional and genetic markers between physically isolated biopsies of a single tumor poses major barriers to the identification of biomarkers and the development of targeted therapies that will be effective against the entire tumor. We analyzed the spatial heterogeneity of multiregional biopsies from 35 patients, using a combination of transcriptomic and genomic profiles. Medulloblastomas (MBs), but not high-grade gliomas (HGGs), demonstrated spatially homogeneous transcriptomes, which allowed for accurate subgrouping of tumors from a single biopsy. Conversely, somatic mutations that affect genes suitable for targeted therapeutics demonstrated high levels of spatial heterogeneity in MB, malignant glioma, and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Actionable targets found in a single MB biopsy were seldom clonal across the entire tumor, which brings the efficacy of monotherapies against a single target into question. Clinical trials of targeted therapies for MB should first ensure the spatially ubiquitous nature of the target mutation.},

	abstract = {Ongoing intratumoral evolution is apparent in molecular variations among cancer cells from different regions of the same tumor, but genetic data alone provide little insight into environmental selection forces and cellular phenotypic adaptations that govern the underlying Darwinian dynamics. In three spontaneous murine cancers (prostate cancers in TRAMP and PTEN mice, pancreatic cancer in KPC mice), we identified two subpopulations with distinct niche-construction adaptive strategies that remained stable in culture: (1) Invasive cells that produce an acidic environment via upregulated aerobic glycolysis, and (2) Non-invasive cells that were angiogenic and metabolically near-normal. Darwinian interactions of these subpopulations were investigated in TRAMP prostate cancers. Computer simulations demonstrated invasive, acid-producing (C2) cells maintain a fitness advantage over non-invasive, angiogenic (C3) cells by promoting invasion and reducing efficacy of immune response. Immunohistochemical analysis of untreated tumors confirmed that C2 cells were invariably more abundant than C3 cells. However, the C2 adaptive strategy phenotype incurred a significant cost due to inefficient energy production (i.e. aerobic glycolysis) and depletion of resources for adaptations to an acidic environment. Mathematical model simulations predicted that small perturbations of the micro-environmental pHe could invert the cost/benefit ratio of the C2 strategy and select for C3 cells. In vivo, 200mM NaHCO3 added to the drinking water of 4 week-old TRAMP mice increased the intraprostatic pHe by 0.2 units and promoted proliferation of noninvasive C3 cells, which remained confined within the ducts so that primary cancer did not develop. A 0.2 pHe increase in established tumors increased the fraction of C3 cells and signficantly diminished growth of primary and metastatic tumors. In an experimental tumor construct, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were co-injected into the mammary fat pad of SCID mice. C2-like MDA-MB-231 cells dominated in untreated animals but C3-like MCF7 cells were selected and tumor growth slowed when intratumoral pHe was increased. Overall, our data support the use of mathematical modeling of intratumoral Darwinian interactions of environmental selection forces and cancer cell adaptive strategies. These models allow the tumor to be steered into a less invasive pathway through the application of small but selective biological force.},

Recent results suggest that the strict hierarchical structure of cancer cell populations advocated by the cancer stem cell model must be reconsidered since the depletion of cancer stem cells leads the other tumor cells to switch back into the cancer stem cell phenotype. This plasticity has important implications for metastasis since migrating cells do not need to be cancer stem cells in order to seed a metastasis. We also discuss the important role of the immune system and the microenvironment in modulating phenotypic switching and suggest possible avenues to exploit our understanding of this process to develop an effective strategy for precision medicine.},

Immune checkpoints refer to a plethora of inhibitory pathways hardwired into the immune system that are crucial for maintaining self-tolerance and modulating the duration and amplitude of physiological immune responses in peripheral tissues in order to minimize collateral tissue damage. It is now clear that tumours co-opt certain immune-checkpoint pathways as a major mechanism of immune resistance, particularly against T cells that are specific for tumour antigens. Because many of the immune checkpoints are initiated by ligand-receptor interactions, they can be readily blocked by antibodies or modulated by recombinant forms of ligands or receptors. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) antibodies were the first of this class of immunotherapeutics to achieve US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Preliminary clinical findings with blockers of additional immune-checkpoint proteins, such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1), indicate broad and diverse opportunities to enhance antitumour immunity with the potential to produce durable clinical responses.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Follicular lymphoma (FL) is an indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has a risk of transformation to more aggressive lymphoma. Relatively little is known about the non-malignant B-cell and T-cell subset composition within the tumor microenvironment and whether altered phenotypes are associated with patterns of lymphoma B-cell heterogeneity.
METHODS: Two mass cytometry (CyTOF) panels were designed to immunophenotype B and T cells in FL tumors. Populations of malignant B cells, non-malignant B cells, and T cells from each FL tumor were identified and their phenotypes compared to B and T cells from healthy human tonsillar tissue.
RESULTS: Diversity in cellular phenotype between tumors was greater for the malignant B cells than for non-malignant B or T cells. The malignant B-cell population bore little phenotypic similarity to any healthy B-cell subset, and unexpectedly clustered closer to naïve B-cell populations than GC B-cell populations. Among the non-malignant B cells within FL tumors, a significant lack of GC and plasmablast B cells was observed relative to tonsil controls. In contrast, non-malignant T cells in FL tumors were present at levels similar to their cognate tonsillar T-cell subsets.
CONCLUSION: Mass cytometry revealed that diverse HLA-DR expression on FL cells within individual tumors contributed greatly to tumor heterogeneity. Both malignant and non-malignant B cells in the tumor bore little phenotypic resemblance to healthy GC B cells despite the presence of T follicular helper cells in the tumor. These findings suggest that ongoing signaling interactions between malignant B cells and intra-tumor T cells shape the tumor microenvironment. This article is protected by copyright.

Using mass cytometry, we profiled surface and intracellular signaling proteins simultaneously in millions of healthy and leukemic cells. We developed PhenoGraph, which algorithmically defines phenotypes in high-dimensional single-cell data. PhenoGraph revealed that the surface phenotypes of leukemic blasts do not necessarily reflect their intracellular state. Using hematopoietic progenitors, we defined a signaling-based measure of cellular phenotype, which led to isolation of a gene expression signature that was predictive of survival in independent cohorts.

Thereafter, a chromosome moves along these microtubule "tracks" as it executes a series of movements that bring it to the spindle equator. After the onset of anaphase, the sister chromatids separate and move to opposite spindle poles. These movements are often characterized by "directional instability" (a series of runs with approximately constant speed, punctuated by sudden reversals in the direction of movement). To understand mitosis, it is critical to describe the physical mechanisms that underlie the coordination of the forces that drive directional instability. We propose a simple mechanistic model that describes the origin of the forces that move chromosomes and the coordination of these forces to produce directional instability. The model demonstrates that forces, speeds, and direction of motion associated with prometaphase through anaphase chromosome movements can be predicted from the molecular kinetics of interactions between dynamic microtubules and arrays of microtubule binding sites that are linked to the chromosome by compliant elements.},

Insufficient control of autoreactive T cells by regulatory T cells (Tregs) is believed to contribute to disease pathogenesis, but changes in Treg function are difficult to quantify because of the lack of Treg-exclusive markers in humans and the complexity of functional experiments. We established a new way to track Tregs by using a gene signature that discriminates between Tregs and conventional T cells regardless of their activation states. The resulting 31-gene panel was validated with the NanoString nCounter platform and then measured in sorted CD4(+)CD25(hi)CD127(lo) Tregs from children with T1D and age-matched control subjects. By using biomarker discovery analysis, we found that expression of a combination of six genes, including TNFRSF1B (CD120b) and FOXP3, was significantly different between Tregs from subjects with new-onset T1D and control subjects, resulting in a sensitive (mean ± SD 0.86 ± 0.14) and specific (0.78 ± 0.18) biomarker algorithm. Thus, although the proportion of Tregs in peripheral blood is similar between children with T1D and control subjects, significant changes in gene expression can be detected early in disease process. These findings provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying the failure to control autoimmunity in T1D and might lead to a biomarker test to monitor Tregs throughout disease progression.},

Applied to the differentiation of primary human myoblasts, Monocle revealed switch-like changes in expression of key regulatory factors, sequential waves of gene regulation, and expression of regulators that were not known to act in differentiation. We validated some of these predicted regulators in a loss-of function screen. Monocle can in principle be used to recover single-cell gene expression kinetics from a wide array of cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation and oncogenic transformation.},

	abstract = {Follicular lymphoma (FL) is incurable with conventional therapies and has a clinical course typified by multiple relapses after therapy. These tumors are genetically characterized by B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) translocation and mutation of genes involved in chromatin modification. By analyzing purified tumor cells, we identified additional novel recurrently mutated genes and confirmed mutations of one or more chromatin modifier genes within 96\% of FL tumors and two or more in 76\% of tumors. We defined the hierarchy of somatic mutations arising during tumor evolution by analyzing the phylogenetic relationship of somatic mutations across the coding genomes of 59 sequentially acquired biopsies from 22 patients. Among all somatically mutated genes, CREBBP mutations were most significantly enriched within the earliest inferable progenitor. These mutations were associated with a signature of decreased antigen presentation characterized by reduced transcript and protein abundance of MHC class II on tumor B cells, in line with the role of CREBBP in promoting class II transactivator (CIITA)-dependent transcriptional activation of these genes. CREBBP mutant B cells stimulated less proliferation of T cells in vitro compared with wild-type B cells from the same tumor. Transcriptional signatures of tumor-infiltrating T cells were indicative of reduced proliferation, and this corresponded to decreased frequencies of tumor-infiltrating CD4 helper T cells and CD8 memory cytotoxic T cells. These observations therefore implicate CREBBP mutation as an early event in FL evolution that contributes to immune evasion via decreased antigen presentation.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12865-015-0113-0},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: High quality genetic material is an essential pre-requisite when analyzing gene expression using microarray technology. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are frequently used for genomic analyses, but several factors can affect the integrity of nucleic acids prior to their extraction, including the methods of PBMC collection and isolation. Due to the lack of the relevant data published, we compared the Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation and BD Vacutainer cell preparation tube (CPT) protocols to determine if either method offered a distinct advantage in preparation of PBMC-derived immune cell subsets for their use in gene expression analysis. We evaluated the yield and purity of immune cell subpopulations isolated from PBMC derived by both methods, the quantity and quality of extracted nucleic acids, and compared gene expression in PBMC and individual immune cell types from Ficoll and CPT isolation protocols using Affymetrix microarrays.
RESULTS: The mean yield and viability of fresh PBMC acquired by the CPT method (1.16 × 10(6) cells/ml, 93.3\%) were compatible to those obtained with Ficoll (1.34 × 10(6) cells/ml, 97.2\%). No differences in the mean purity, recovery, and viability of CD19+ (B cells), CD8+ (cytotoxic T cells), CD4+ (helper T cell) and CD14+ (monocytes) positively selected from CPT- or Ficoll-isolated PBMC were found. Similar quantities of high quality RNA and DNA were extracted from PBMC and immune cells obtained by both methods. Finally, the PBMC isolation methods tested did not impact subsequent recovery and purity of individual immune cell subsets and, importantly, their gene expression profiles.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that the CPT and Ficoll PBMC isolation protocols do not differ in their ability to purify high quality immune cell subpopulations. Since there was no difference in the gene expression profiles between immune cells obtained by these two methods, the Ficoll isolation can be substituted by the CPT protocol without conceding phenotypic changes of immune cells and compromising the gene expression studies. Given that the CPT protocol is less elaborate, minimizes cells' handling and processing time, this method offers a significant operating advantage, especially in large-scale clinical studies aiming at dissecting gene expression in PBMC and PBMC-derived immune cell subpopulations.},

In cancer biology, evolution explains how populations of cells in tumors change over time. It is a fundamental question whether this evolutionary process is driven primarily by natural selection and adaptation or by other evolutionary processes such as founder effects and drift. In cancer biology, as in organismal evolutionary biology, there is controversy about this question and also about the use of adaptation through natural selection as a guiding framework for research. In this review, we discuss the differences and similarities between evolution among somatic cells versus evolution among organisms. We review what is known about the parameters and rate of evolution in neoplasms, as well as evidence for adaptation. We conclude that adaptation is a useful framework that accurately explains the defining characteristics of cancer. Further, convergent evolution through natural selection provides the only satisfying explanation both for how a group of diverse pathologies have enough in common to usefully share the descriptive label of “cancer” and for why this convergent condition becomes life-threatening.},

	abstract = {Cells rely on a network of conserved pathways to govern DNA replication fidelity. Loss of polymerase proofreading or mismatch repair elevates spontaneous mutation and facilitates cellular adaptation. However, double mutants are inviable, suggesting that extreme mutation rates exceed an error threshold. Here we combine alleles that affect DNA polymerase δ (Pol δ) proofreading and mismatch repair to define the maximal error rate in haploid yeast and to characterize genetic suppressors of mutator phenotypes. We show that populations tolerate mutation rates 1,000-fold above wild-type levels but collapse when the rate exceeds 10⁻³ inactivating mutations per gene per cell division. Variants that escape this error-induced extinction (eex) rapidly emerge from mutator clones. One-third of the escape mutants result from second-site changes in Pol δ that suppress the proofreading-deficient phenotype, while two-thirds are extragenic. The structural locations of the Pol δ changes suggest multiple antimutator mechanisms. Our studies reveal the transient nature of eukaryotic mutators and show that mutator phenotypes are readily suppressed by genetic adaptation. This has implications for the role of mutator phenotypes in cancer.},

	abstract = {RNA viruses evolve rapidly. One source of this ability to rapidly change is the apparently high mutation frequency in RNA virus populations. A high mutation frequency is a central tenet of the quasispecies theory. A corollary of the quasispecies theory postulates that, given their high mutation frequency, animal RNA viruses may be susceptible to error catastrophe, where they undergo a sharp drop in viability after a modest increase in mutation frequency. We recently showed that the important broad-spectrum antiviral drug ribavirin (currently used to treat hepatitis C virus infections, among others) is an RNA virus mutagen, and we proposed that ribavirin's antiviral effect is by forcing RNA viruses into error catastrophe. However, a direct demonstration of error catastrophe has not been made for ribavirin or any RNA virus mutagen. Here we describe a direct demonstration of error catastrophe by using ribavirin as the mutagen and poliovirus as a model RNA virus. We demonstrate that ribavirin's antiviral activity is exerted directly through lethal mutagenesis of the viral genetic material. A 99.3\% loss in viral genome infectivity is observed after a single round of virus infection in ribavirin concentrations sufficient to cause a 9.7-fold increase in mutagenesis. Compiling data on both the mutation levels and the specific infectivities of poliovirus genomes produced in the presence of ribavirin, we have constructed a graph of error catastrophe showing that normal poliovirus indeed exists at the edge of viability. These data suggest that RNA virus mutagens may represent a promising new class of antiviral drugs.},

	abstract = {In small or repeatedly bottlenecked populations, mutations are expected to accumulate by genetic drift, causing fitness declines. In mutational meltdown models, such fitness declines further reduce population size, thus accelerating additional mutation accumulation and leading to extinction. Because the rate of mutation accumulation is determined partly by the mutation rate, the risk and rate of meltdown are predicted to increase with increasing mutation rate. We established 12 replicate populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae from each of two isogenic strains whose genomewide mutation rates differ by approximately two orders of magnitude. Each population was transferred daily by a fixed dilution that resulted in an effective population size near 250. Fitness declines that reduce growth rates were expected to reduce the numbers of cells transferred after dilution, thus reducing population size and leading to mutational meltdown. Through 175 daily transfers and approximately 2900 generations, two extinctions occurred, both in populations with elevated mutation rates. For one of these populations there is direct evidence that extinction resulted from mutational meltdown: Extinction immediately followed a major fitness decline, and it recurred consistently in replicate populations reestablished from a sample frozen after this fitness decline, but not in populations founded from a predecline sample. Wild-type populations showed no trend to decrease in size and, on average, they increased in fitness.},

Methods to detect MSI are well established and routinely incorporated into clinical practice. A clinical and molecular profile of MSI tumors has been described, leading to the concept of an MSI phenotype in CRC. Studies have confirmed that MSI tumors have a better prognosis than microsatellite stable CRC, but MSI cancers do not necessarily have the same response to the chemotherapeutic strategies used to treat microsatellite stable tumors. Specifically, stage II MSI tumors might not benefit from 5-fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy regimens. New data suggest possible advantages of irinotecan-based regimens, but these findings require further clarification. Characterization of the molecular basis of MSI in CRC is underway and initial results show that mutations in genes encoding kinases and candidate genes with microsatellite tracts are over-represented in MSI tumors.

The heterogeneity of SHM pattern in FL intrigued us to investigate the AID expression. AID expression was investigated in 19 FL materials consisting of 15 cases of FL fresh cells and four cell lines. In all, 10 fresh cells and three cell lines expressed AID, but the others did not. SHM was investigated in 12 fresh cells and four cell lines. The ongoing mutation was significantly different between AID-positive and AID-negative FL fresh cells (unpaired Student's t-test, P=0.047). Ongoing mutation was not seen in any of the cell lines. AID expression was associated with the ongoing mutation in FL fresh cells (two-tailed Pearson's coefficient correlation, r=0.899, P=0.01). The switch off of AID expression may start in the B-lineage differentiation stage counterpart of FL after optimizing SHM, indicated by the cessation of the ongoing mutation in AID-negative FL fresh cells.},

	abstract = {Glioblastoma is an incurable brain tumor. It is characterized by intratumoral phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity, but the functional significance of this heterogeneity is unclear. We devised an integrated functional and genomic strategy to obtain single cell-derived tumor clones directly from patient tumors to identify mechanisms of aggressive clone behavior and drug resistance. Genomic analysis of single clones identified genes associated with clonal phenotypes. We predict that integration of functional and genomic analysis at a clonal level will be essential for understanding evolution and therapeutic resistance of human cancer, and will lead to the discovery of novel driver mechanisms and clone-specific cancer treatment., Glioblastoma (GBM) is a cancer comprised of morphologically, genetically, and phenotypically diverse cells. However, an understanding of the functional significance of intratumoral heterogeneity is lacking. We devised a method to isolate and functionally profile tumorigenic clones from patient glioblastoma samples. Individual clones demonstrated unique proliferation and differentiation abilities. Importantly, naïve patient tumors included clones that were temozolomide resistant, indicating that resistance to conventional GBM therapy can preexist in untreated tumors at a clonal level. Further, candidate therapies for resistant clones were detected with clone-specific drug screening. Genomic analyses revealed genes and pathways that associate with specific functional behavior of single clones. Our results suggest that functional clonal profiling used to identify tumorigenic and drug-resistant tumor clones will lead to the discovery of new GBM clone-specific treatment strategies.},

We implicate PARP-3 in the accumulation of APLF at DSBs and demonstrate that APLF promotes the retention of XRCC4/DNA ligase IV complex in chromatin, suggesting that PARP-3 and APLF accelerate DNA ligation during nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ). Consistent with this, we show that class switch recombination in Aplf(-/-) B cells is biased toward microhomology-mediated end-joining, a pathway that operates in the absence of XRCC4/DNA ligase IV, and that the requirement for PARP-3 and APLF for NHEJ is circumvented by overexpression of XRCC4/DNA ligase IV.

We performed whole-exome sequencing of 86 matched brain metastases, primary tumors, and normal tissue. In all clonally related cancer samples, we observed branched evolution, where all metastatic and primary sites shared a common ancestor yet continued to evolve independently. In 53\% of cases, we found potentially clinically informative alterations in the brain metastases not detected in the matched primary-tumor sample. In contrast, spatially and temporally separated brain metastasis sites were genetically homogenous. Distal extracranial and regional lymph node metastases were highly divergent from brain metastases. We detected alterations associated with sensitivity to PI3K/AKT/mTOR, CDK, and HER2/EGFR inhibitors in the brain metastases. Genomic analysis of brain metastases provides an opportunity to identify potentially clinically informative alterations not detected in clinically sampled primary tumors, regional lymph nodes, or extracranial metastases.
SIGNIFICANCE: Decisions for individualized therapies in patients with brain metastasis are often made from primary-tumor biopsies. We demonstrate that clinically actionable alterations present in brain metastases are frequently not detected in primary biopsies, suggesting that sequencing of primary biopsies alone may miss a substantial number of opportunities for targeted therapy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: An improvement in overall survival among patients with metastatic melanoma has been an elusive goal. In this phase 3 study, ipilimumab--which blocks cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 to potentiate an antitumor T-cell response--administered with or without a glycoprotein 100 (gp100) peptide vaccine was compared with gp100 alone in patients with previously treated metastatic melanoma.
METHODS: A total of 676 HLA-A*0201-positive patients with unresectable stage III or IV melanoma, whose disease had progressed while they were receiving therapy for metastatic disease, were randomly assigned, in a 3:1:1 ratio, to receive ipilimumab plus gp100 (403 patients), ipilimumab alone (137), or gp100 alone (136). Ipilimumab, at a dose of 3 mg per kilogram of body weight, was administered with or without gp100 every 3 weeks for up to four treatments (induction). Eligible patients could receive reinduction therapy. The primary end point was overall survival.
RESULTS: The median overall survival was 10.0 months among patients receiving ipilimumab plus gp100, as compared with 6.4 months among patients receiving gp100 alone (hazard ratio for death, 0.68; P{\textless}0.001). The median overall survival with ipilimumab alone was 10.1 months (hazard ratio for death in the comparison with gp100 alone, 0.66; P=0.003). No difference in overall survival was detected between the ipilimumab groups (hazard ratio with ipilimumab plus gp100, 1.04; P=0.76). Grade 3 or 4 immune-related adverse events occurred in 10 to 15\% of patients treated with ipilimumab and in 3\% treated with gp100 alone. There were 14 deaths related to the study drugs (2.1\%), and 7 were associated with immune-related adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: Ipilimumab, with or without a gp100 peptide vaccine, as compared with gp100 alone, improved overall survival in patients with previously treated metastatic melanoma. Adverse events can be severe, long-lasting, or both, but most are reversible with appropriate treatment. (Funded by Medarex and Bristol-Myers Squibb; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00094653.)},

Resistance to oxidative stress correlates with delayed aging in mammals, in the absence of accelerated tumorigenesis, suggesting inactivation of selected p53-downstream pathways. We investigated p53 regulation in mice carrying deletion of p66, a mutation that retards aging and confers cellular resistance and systemic resistance to oxidative stress. We identified a transcriptional network of {\textasciitilde}200 genes that are repressed by p53 and encode for determinants of progression through mitosis or suppression of senescence. They are selectively down-regulated in cultured fibroblasts after oxidative stress, and, in vivo, in proliferating tissues and during physiological aging. Selectivity is imposed by p66 expression and activation of p44/p53 (also named Delta40p53), a p53 isoform that accelerates aging and prevents mitosis after protein damage. p66 deletion retards aging and increases longevity of p44/p53 transgenic mice. Thus, oxidative stress activates a specific p53 transcriptional response, mediated by p44/p53 and p66, which regulates cellular senescence and aging.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of mutation processes is central to understanding virtually all evolutionary phenomena and the underlying nature of genetic disorders and cancers. However, the limitations of standard molecular mutation detection methods have historically precluded a genome-wide understanding of mutation rates and spectra in the nuclear genomes of multicellular organisms. We applied two high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies to identify and characterize hundreds of spontaneously arising base-substitution mutations in 10 Caenorhabditis elegans mutation-accumulation (MA)-line nuclear genomes. C. elegans mutation rate estimates were similar to previous calculations based on smaller numbers of mutations. Mutations were distributed uniformly within and among chromosomes and were not associated with recombination rate variation in the MA lines, suggesting that intragenomic variation in genetic hitchhiking and/or background selection are primarily responsible for the chromosomal distribution patterns of polymorphic nucleotides in C. elegans natural populations. A strong mutational bias from G/C to A/T nucleotides was detected in the MA lines, implicating oxidative DNA damage as a major endogenous mutagenic force in C. elegans. The observed mutational bias also suggests that the C. elegans nuclear genome cannot be at equilibrium because of mutation alone. Transversions dominate the spectrum of spontaneous mutations observed here, whereas transitions dominate patterns of allegedly neutral polymorphism in natural populations of C. elegans and many other animal species; this observation challenges the assumption that natural patterns of molecular variation in noncoding regions of the nuclear genome accurately reflect underlying mutation processes.},

We report here that under oxidative stress conditions the majority of base substitution mutations in ssDNA are caused by erroneous, DNA polymerase (Pol) zeta-independent bypass of cytosines, resulting in C to T transitions. For all other DNA bases Pol zeta is essential for ROS-induced mutagenesis. The density of ROS-induced mutations in ssDNA is lower, compared to that caused by UV and MMS, which suggests that ssDNA could be actively protected from oxidative damage.

The mechanism by which DNA-damaging agents elevate p53 protein levels to trigger G1/S arrest or cell death remains to be elucidated. In fact, whether damage to the DNA template itself participates in transducing the signal leading to p53 induction has not yet been demonstrated. We exposed human cell lines containing wild-type p53 alleles to several different DNA-damaging agents and found that agents which rapidly induce DNA strand breaks, such as ionizing radiation, bleomycin, and DNA topoisomerase-targeted drugs, rapidly triggered p53 protein elevations. In addition, we determined that camptothecin-stimulated trapping of topoisomerase I-DNA complexes was not sufficient to elevate p53 protein levels; rather, replication-associated DNA strand breaks were required. Furthermore, treatment of cells with the antimetabolite N(phosphonoacetyl)-L-aspartate (PALA) did not cause rapid p53 protein increases but resulted in delayed increases in p53 protein levels temporally correlated with the appearance of DNA strand breaks. Finally, we concluded that DNA strand breaks were sufficient for initiating p53-dependent signal transduction after finding that introduction of nucleases into cells by electroporation stimulated rapid p53 protein elevations. While DNA strand breaks appeared to be capable of triggering p53 induction, DNA lesions other than strand breaks did not. Exposure of normal cells and excision repair-deficient xeroderma pigmentosum cells to low doses of UV light, under conditions in which thymine dimers appear but DNA replication-associated strand breaks were prevented, resulted in p53 induction attributable to DNA strand breaks associated with excision repair. Our data indicate that DNA strand breaks are sufficient and probably necessary for p53 induction in cells with wild-type p53 alleles exposed to DNA-damaging agents.},

 evade immunological and chemical antiviral agents. We tested the
 hypothesis that a further increase in the mutation rate by promutagenic

 deoxynucleoside analogs for lack of toxicity to human cells,
 incorporation by HIV reverse transcriptase, resistance to repair when
 incorporated into the DNA strand of an RNA⋅DNA hybrid, and
 mispairing at high frequency. Among the candidates tested,
 5-hydroxydeoxycytidine (5-OH-dC) fulfilled these criteria. In seven of
 nine experiments, the presence of this analog resulted in the loss of
 viral replicative potential after 9–24 sequential passages of HIV in
 human CEM cells. In contrast, loss of viral replication was not
 observed in 28 control cultures passaged in the absence of the
 nucleoside analog, nor with other analogs tested. Sequence analysis of
 a portion of the HIV reverse transcriptase gene demonstrated a
 disproportionate increase in G → A substitutions, mutations predicted
 to result from misincorporation of 5-OH-dC into the cDNA during reverse
 transcription. Thus, “lethal mutagenesis” driven by the class of
 deoxynucleoside analogs represented by 5-OH-dC could provide a new

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0005860},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tumorigenesis requires multiple genetic changes. Mutator mutations are mutations that increase genomic instability, and according to the mutator hypothesis, accelerate tumorigenesis by facilitating oncogenic mutations. Alternatively, repeated lineage selection and expansion without increased mutation frequency may explain observed cancer incidence. Mutator lineages also risk increased deleterious mutations, leading to extinction, thus providing another counterargument to the mutator hypothesis. Both selection and extinction involve changes in lineage fitness, which may be represented as "trajectories" through a "fitness landscape" defined by genetics and environment.
METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here I systematically analyze the relative efficiency of tumorigenesis with and without mutator mutations by evaluating archetypal fitness trajectories using deterministic and stochastic mathematical models. I hypothesize that tumorigenic mechanisms occur clinically in proportion to their relative efficiency. This work quantifies the relative importance of mutator pathways as a function of experimentally measurable parameters, demonstrating that mutator pathways generally enhance efficiency of tumorigenesis. An optimal mutation rate for tumor evolution is derived, and shown to differ from that for species evolution.
CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The models address the major counterarguments to the mutator hypothesis, confirming that mutator mechanisms are generally more efficient routes to tumorigenesis than non-mutator mechanisms. Mutator mutations are more likely to occur early, and to occur when more oncogenic mutations are required to create a tumor. Mutator mutations likely occur in a minority of premalignant lesions, but these mutator premalignant lesions are disproportionately likely to develop into malignant tumors. Tumor heterogeneity due to mutator mutations may contribute to therapeutic resistance, and the degree of heterogeneity of tumors may need to be considered when therapeutic strategies are devised. The model explains and predicts important biological observations in bacterial and mouse systems, as well as clinical observations.},

	abstract = {The metastatic stability of clones, which were derived from the murine UV-2237 fibrosarcoma and which exhibit low or high metastatic potential, was examined after 60-72 days of continuous growth in vitro and in vivo. Subclones of the high metastatic clone exhibited a 140-fold variation in the production of experimental pulmonary metastases after intravenous injection into syngeneic C3H- mice. In contrast, subclones from the low metastatic clone varied only slightly (8-fold). Using cloned cells from three mouse tumors with differing metastatic potential, we determined the spontaneous mutation rates of cells with low or high metastatic capacities with respect to the selective genetic markers, 6-thiopurine resistance or ouabain resistance, or both. In all cases, cells with high metastatic potential had a 3- to 7-fold increase in the rate of mutation (per cell generation) at both genetic loci, as compared with their low metastatic but tumorigenic cell controls. These results support the hypothesis that the evolution of tumors from the benign to the malignant state could be the consequence of acquired genetic instability in the neoplastic cells.},

However, while this technology has the capacity to generate hundreds of billions of nucleotides of DNA sequence in a single experiment, the error rate of {\textasciitilde}1\% results in hundreds of millions of sequencing mistakes. These scattered errors can be tolerated in some applications but become extremely problematic when "deep sequencing" genetically heterogeneous mixtures, such as tumors or mixed microbial populations. To overcome limitations in sequencing accuracy, we have developed a method termed Duplex Sequencing. This approach greatly reduces errors by independently tagging and sequencing each of the two strands of a DNA duplex. As the two strands are complementary, true mutations are found at the same position in both strands. In contrast, PCR or sequencing errors result in mutations in only one strand and can thus be discounted as technical error. We determine that Duplex Sequencing has a theoretical background error rate of less than one artifactual mutation per billion nucleotides sequenced. In addition, we establish that detection of mutations present in only one of the two strands of duplex DNA can be used to identify sites of DNA damage. We apply the method to directly assess the frequency and pattern of random mutations in mitochondrial DNA from human cells.},

Expression of a kinase-inactive allele of ATR (ATRkd) in human fibroblasts causes increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR), cis-platinum and methyl methanesulfonate, but only slight UV radiation sensitivity. ATRkd overexpression abrogates the G2/M arrest after exposure to IR, and overexpression of wild-type ATR complements the radioresistant DNA synthesis phenotype of cells lacking ATM, suggesting a potential functional overlap between these proteins. ATRkd overexpression also causes increased sensitivity to hydroxyurea that is associated with microtubule-mediated nuclear abnormalities. These observations are consistent with uncoupling of certain mitotic events from the completion of S-phase. Thus, ATR is an important component of multiple DNA damage response pathways and may be involved in the DNA replication (S/M) checkpoint.},

METHODS: Gene-expression profiling was performed on 191 biopsy specimens obtained from patients with untreated follicular lymphoma. Supervised methods were used to discover expression patterns associated with the length of survival in a training set of 95 specimens. A molecular predictor of survival was constructed from these genes and validated in an independent test set of 96 specimens.
RESULTS: Individual genes that predicted the length of survival were grouped into gene-expression signatures on the basis of their expression in the training set, and two such signatures were used to construct a survival predictor. The two signatures allowed patients with specimens in the test set to be divided into four quartiles with widely disparate median lengths of survival (13.6, 11.1, 10.8, and 3.9 years), independently of clinical prognostic variables. Flow cytometry showed that these signatures reflected gene expression by nonmalignant tumor-infiltrating immune cells.
CONCLUSIONS: The length of survival among patients with follicular lymphoma correlates with the molecular features of nonmalignant immune cells present in the tumor at diagnosis.},

This unexpected finding has led us to carry out an extensive investigation of these structures. Our results show that plates can also be found in metaphase chromosomes from chicken lymphocytes. We have used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to image and investigate the mechanical properties of plates in aqueous solution. Plates are thin (approximately 6.5 nm each layer) but compact and resistant to penetration by the AFM tip: their Young's modulus is approximately 0.2 GPa and the stress required for surface penetration is approximately 0.03 GPa in the presence of Mg(2+) (5-20 mM). Low-ionic strength conditions produce emanation of chromatin fibers from the edges of uncrosslinked plates. These observations and AFM results obtained applying high forces indicate that the chromatin filament is tightly tethered inside the plates. Images of metal-shadowed plates and cryo-electron microscopy images of frozen-hydrated plates suggest that nucleosomes are tilted with respect to the plate surface to allow an interdigitation between the successive layers and a thickness reduction compatible with the observed plate height. The similarities between denatured plates from chicken chromosomes and aggregates of purified chromatin from chicken erythrocytes suggest that chromatin has intrinsic structural properties leading to plate formation. Scanning electron micrographs and images obtained with the 200-kV transmission microscope show that plates are the dominant component of compact chromatids.

Chromatin bands and the connection surfaces in sister chromatid exchanges and in cancer translocations are planar and orthogonal to the chromosome axis. Chromosome stretching produces band splitting and even the thinnest bands are orthogonal and well defined, indicating that short stretches of DNA can occupy completely the chromosome cross-section. These observations impose strong physical constraints on models that attempt to explain chromatin folding in chromosomes. The thin-plate model, which consists of many stacked layers of planar chromatin perpendicular to the chromosome axis, is compatible with the observed orientation of bands, with the existence of thin bands, and with band splitting; it is also compatible with the orthogonal orientation and planar geometry of the connection surfaces in chromosome rearrangements.

By immobilizing microscopic chromatin-coated beads on slide surfaces using a microprinting technique, we have examined the effect of chromatin on the dimensions and symmetry of spindles in Xenopus laevis cytoplasmic extracts. While circular spots with diameters around 14–18 μm trigger bipolar spindle formation, larger spots generate an incorrect number of poles. We also examined lines of chromatin with various dimensions. Their length determined the number of poles that formed, with a 6 × 18 μm rectangular patch generating normal spindle morphology. Around longer lines, multiple poles formed and the structures were disorganized. While lines thinner than 10 μm generated symmetric structures, thicker lines induced the formation of asymmetric structures where all microtubules are on the same side of the line. Our results show that chromatin defines spindle shape and orientation., For a video summary of this article, see the PaperFlick file available with the online  Supplemental Data .},

We review current models of spindle assembly, positioning, maintenance and elongation; of chromosome capture and congression; and of the spindle assembly checkpoint.

Here we present viSNE, a tool that allows one to map high-dimensional cytometry data onto two dimensions, yet conserve the high-dimensional structure of the data. viSNE plots individual cells in a visual similar to a scatter plot, while using all pairwise distances in high dimension to determine each cell's location in the plot. We integrated mass cytometry with viSNE to map healthy and cancerous bone marrow samples. Healthy bone marrow automatically maps into a consistent shape, whereas leukemia samples map into malformed shapes that are distinct from healthy bone marrow and from each other. We also use viSNE and mass cytometry to compare leukemia diagnosis and relapse samples, and to identify a rare leukemia population reminiscent of minimal residual disease. viSNE can be applied to any multi-dimensional single-cell technology.},

To date, transcriptional profiling has been used to highlight similarities between DLBCL tumor cells and normal B-cell subtypes and associate genes and pathways with unfavorable outcome. To identify robust and highly reproducible DL-BCL subtypes with comprehensive transcriptional signatures, we used a large series of newly diagnosed DLBCLs, whole genome arrays, and multiple clustering methods. Tumors were also analyzed for known common genetic abnormalities in DLBCL. There were 3 discrete subsets of DLBCL-"oxidative phosphorylation," "B-cell receptor/proliferation," and "host response" (HR)-identified characterized using gene set enrichment analysis and confirmed in an independent series. HR tumors had increased expression of T/natural killer cell receptor and activation pathway components, complement cascade members, macrophage/dendritic cell markers, and inflammatory mediators. HR DLB-CLs also contained significantly higher numbers of morphologically distinct CD2+/CD3+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and interdigitating S100+/gamma interferon-induced lysosomal transferase-positive (GILT+) CD1a-/CD123- dendritic cells. The HR cluster shared features of histologically defined T-cell/histiocyte-rich B-cell lymphoma, including fewer genetic abnormalities, younger age at presentation, and frequent splenic and bone marrow involvement. These studies identify tumor microenvironment and host inflammatory response as defining features in DLBCL and suggest rational treatment targets in specific DLBCL subsets.},

The higher order functional information is stored in the PATHWAY database, which contains graphical representations of cellular processes, such as metabolism, membrane transport, signal transduction and cell cycle. The PATHWAY database is supplemented by a set of ortholog group tables for the information about conserved subpathways (pathway motifs), which are often encoded by positionally coupled genes on the chromosome and which are especially useful in predicting gene functions. A third database in KEGG is LIGAND for the information about chemical compounds, enzyme molecules and enzymatic reactions. KEGG provides Java graphics tools for browsing genome maps, comparing two genome maps and manipulating expression maps, as well as computational tools for sequence comparison, graph comparison and path computation.

We identified recurrent mutations in linker histone, JAK-STAT signaling, NF-κB signaling and B cell developmental genes. Longitudinal analyses identified early driver mutations in chromatin regulator genes (CREBBP, EZH2 and KMT2D (MLL2)), whereas mutations in EBF1 and regulators of NF-κB signaling (MYD88 and TNFAIP3) were gained at transformation. Collectively, this study provides new insights into the genetic basis of follicular lymphoma and the clonal dynamics of transformation and suggests that personalizing therapies to target key genetic alterations in the CPC represents an attractive therapeutic strategy.},

Currently, the opposing merits of the four IgG subclasses are considered with respect to the in vivo biological activities considered to be appropriate to the disease indication being treated. Human heavy chain genes also exhibit extensive structural polymorphism(s) and, being closely linked, are inherited as a haplotype. Polymorphisms (allotypes) within the IgG isotype were originally discovered and described using serological reagents derived from humans; demonstrating that allotypic variants can be immunogenic and provoke antibody responses as a result of allo-immunization. The serologically defined allotypes differ widely within and between population groups; therefore, a mAb of a given allotype will, inevitably, be delivered to a cohort of patients homozygous for the alternative allotype.

	abstract = {The process of programmed cell death, or apoptosis, is generally characterized by distinct morphological characteristics and energy-dependent biochemical mechanisms. Apoptosis is considered a vital component of various processes including normal cell turnover, proper development and functioning of the immune system, hormone-dependent atrophy, embryonic development and chemical-induced cell death. Inappropriate apoptosis (either too little or too much) is a factor in many human conditions including neurodegenerative diseases, ischemic damage, autoimmune disorders and many types of cancer. The ability to modulate the life or death of a cell is recognized for its immense therapeutic potential. Therefore, research continues to focus on the elucidation and analysis of the cell cycle machinery and signaling pathways that control cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. To that end, the field of apoptosis research has been moving forward at an alarmingly rapid rate. Although many of the key apoptotic proteins have been identified, the molecular mechanisms of action or inaction of these proteins remain to be elucidated. The goal of this review is to provide a general overview of current knowledge on the process of apoptosis including morphology, biochemistry, the role of apoptosis in health and disease, detection methods, as well as a discussion of potential alternative forms of apoptosis.},

	abstract = {Chemokines are likely to play important roles in the pathophysiology of diseases associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Here, we have analyzed the repertoire of chemokines expressed by EBV-infected B cells. EBV infection of B cells induced expression of TARC/CCL17 and MDC/CCL22, which are known to attract Th2 cells and regulatory T cells via CCR4, and also upregulated constitutive expression of MIP-1 alpha/CCL3, MIP-1 beta/CCL4, and RANTES/CCL5, which are known to attract Th1 cells and cytotoxic T cells via CCR5. Accordingly, EBV-immortalized B cells secreted these chemokines, especially CCL3, CCL4, and CCL22, in large quantities. EBV infection or stable expression of LMP1 also induced CCL17 and CCL22 in a B-cell line, BJAB. The inhibitors of the TRAF/NF-kappa B pathway (BAY11-7082) and the p38/ATF2 pathway (SB202190) selectively suppressed the expression of CCL17 and CCL22 in EBV-immortalized B cells and BJAB-LMP1. Consistently, transient-transfection assays using CCL22 promoter-reporter constructs demonstrated that two NF-kappa B sites and a single AP-1 site were involved in the activation of the CCL22 promoter by LMP1. Finally, serum CCL22 levels were significantly elevated in infectious mononucleosis. Collectively, LMP1 induces CCL17 and CCL22 in EBV-infected B cells via activation of NF-kappa B and probably ATF2. Production of CCL17 and CCL22, which attract Th2 and regulatory T cells, may help EBV-infected B cells evade immune surveillance by Th1 cells. However, the concomitant production of CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 by EBV-infected B cells may eventually attract Th1 cells and cytotoxic T cells, leading to elimination of EBV-infected B cells at latency III and to selection of those with limited expression of latent genes.},

	abstract = {Mitosis is triggered by the activation of Cdk1-cyclin B1 and its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Positive feedback loops regulate the activation of Cdk1-cyclin B1 and help make the process irreversible and all-or-none in character. Here we examine whether an analogous process, spatial positive feedback, regulates Cdk1-cyclin B1 redistribution. We used chemical biology approaches and live-cell microscopy to show that nuclear Cdk1-cyclin B1 promotes the translocation of Cdk1-cyclin B1 to the nucleus. Mechanistic studies suggest that cyclin B1 phosphorylation promotes nuclear translocation and, conversely, nuclear translocation promotes cyclin B1 phosphorylation, accounting for the feedback. Interfering with the abruptness of Cdk1-cyclin B1 translocation affects the timing and synchronicity of subsequent mitotic events, underscoring the functional importance of this feedback. We propose that spatial positive feedback ensures a rapid, complete, robust, and irreversible transition from interphase to mitosis and suggest that bistable spatiotemporal switches may be widespread in biological regulation.},

	abstract = {Signaling pathways that respond to DNA damage are essential for the maintenance of genome stability and are linked to many diseases, including cancer. Here, a genome-wide siRNA screen was employed to identify additional genes involved in genome stabilization by monitoring phosphorylation of the histone variant H2AX, an early mark of DNA damage. We identified hundreds of genes whose downregulation led to elevated levels of H2AX phosphorylation (gammaH2AX) and revealed links to cellular complexes and to genes with unclassified functions. We demonstrate a widespread role for mRNA-processing factors in preventing DNA damage, which in some cases is caused by aberrant RNA-DNA structures. Furthermore, we connect increased gammaH2AX levels to the neurological disorder Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) syndrome, and we find a role for several CMT proteins in the DNA-damage response. These data indicate that preservation of genome stability is mediated by a larger network of biological processes than previously appreciated.},

Mechanistic models based on functional data from tumor biopsies will enable the response to treatment to be predicted for a specific patient, in contrast to statistical models in which the probability of response for a given patient may differ substantially from the population average. This review summarizes mathematical models developed to improve the design of treatment regimens using cell-cycle phase-specific chemotherapy. It starts with simple models of dose response, then moves to more complex models of scheduling cell-cycle phase-specific drugs, and finally discusses mechanistic models that incorporate both genetic drug resistance and cell cycle-mediated drug resistance. This last class of models will be most useful in designing treatment regimens tailored for individual patients.},

The CRM has been proposed as an alternative design of a traditional cohort design and its essential features are the sequential (continual) selection of a dose level for the next patients based on the dose-toxicity relationship and the updating of the relationship based on patients' response data using Bayesian calculation. The original CRM has been criticized because it often tends to allocate too toxic doses to many patients and our proposal for overcoming this practical problem is to monitor a posterior density function of the occurrence of the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) at each dose level. A simulation study shows that strategies based on our proposal allocate a smaller number of patients to doses higher than the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) compared with the original method while the mean squared error of the probability of the DLT occurrence at the MTD is not inflated. We present a couple of extensions of the CRM with real prospective applications: (i) monitoring efficacy and toxicity simultaneously in a combination phase I/II trial; (ii) combining the idea of pharmacokinetically guided dose escalation (PKGDE) and utilization of animal toxicity data in determining the prior distribution. A stopping rule based on the idea of separation among the DLT density functions is discussed in the first example and a strategy for determining the model parameter of the dose-toxicity relationship is suggested in the second example.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases.
RESULTS: To align our large ({\textgreater}80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of {\textgreater}50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.

	abstract = {DNA damaging agents can promote aging, disease and cancer and they are ubiquitous in the environment and produced within human cells as normal cellular metabolites. Ironically, at high doses DNA damaging agents are also used to treat cancer. The ability to quantify DNA damage responses is thus critical in the public health, pharmaceutical and clinical domains. Here, we describe a novel platform that exploits microfabrication techniques to pattern cells in a fixed microarray. The ‘CometChip’ is based upon the well-established single cell gel electrophoresis assay (a.k.a. the comet assay), which estimates the level of DNA damage by evaluating the extent of DNA migration through a matrix in an electrical field. The type of damage measured by this assay includes abasic sites, crosslinks, and strand breaks. Instead of being randomly dispersed in agarose in the traditional assay, cells are captured into an agarose microwell array by gravity. The platform also expands from the size of a standard microscope slide to a 96-well format, enabling parallel processing. Here we describe the protocols of using the chip to evaluate DNA damage caused by known genotoxic agents and the cellular repair response followed after exposure. Through the integration of biological and engineering principles, this method potentiates robust and sensitive measurements of DNA damage in human cells and provides the necessary throughput for genotoxicity testing, drug development, epidemiological studies and clinical assays.},

Our computer simulations show that even when all cells have identical mutation and growth rates, testing bulk samples frequently leads to spurious detection of rate differences.

In malignancies identified as evolving neutrally, all clonal selection seemingly occurred before the onset of cancer growth and not in later-arising subclones, resulting in numerous passenger mutations that are responsible for intratumoral heterogeneity. Reanalyzing cancer sequencing data within the neutral framework allowed the measurement, in each patient, of both the in vivo mutation rate and the order and timing of mutations.

	abstract = {The G2 chromosomal radiosensitivity of murine SCID (severe combined immunodeficient) and normal fibroblasts has been investigated. We have also investigated the G2 response of these cell lines to the restriction endonuclease PvuII. We show that chromatid breaks are induced linearly with radiation dose in both cell lines and SCID cells are approximately 1.6 times as radiosensitive as normal murine fibroblasts when tested using a G2 assay with a 2 h sampling time. The disappearance of chromatid breaks with time after irradiation was first order with a half-time of approximately 1.5 h in both cell lines. Thus, although SCID cells are deficient in the rejoining of double-strand breaks (dsb), they show similar kinetics of disappearance of chromatid breaks with time as normal CB17 cells, indicating that the 'rejoining' of chromatid breaks does not reflect dsb repair. When CB17 and SCID cells were treated with PvuII, which generates dsb in cellular DNA in the presence of streptolysin O (as a porating agent), approximately 3 times more chromatid breaks were observed in SCID than CB17 cells. We conclude that SCID cells convert a higher number of dsb into chromatid breaks than do CB17 cells. The conversion process is interpreted in terms of the recently proposed 'signal' model, whereby a signal, resulting from a single dsb, triggers the cell to make a recombinational exchange which, if incomplete, gives rise to a visible chromatid break. In terms of the signal model, elevated conversion of dsb into chromatid breaks results from altered signalling and the disappearance of chromatid breaks with time following irradiation represents the completion of recombinational exchanges rather than repair of dsb.},

Increased levels of spontaneous aberrations were not a general feature of the xrs strains, although xrs-7 did show a 2-fold increase in chromatid gaps. Unsynchronied populations of xrs cells, estimated to have been irradiated in late S and G2, showed a 3-5-fold increase in chromatid gaps, breaks and exchanges compared to CHO-K1. The irradiation of synchronised populations of xrs-7 and CHO-K1 in G1 demonstrated a 3-5-fold increase in chromosome breaks, gaps and exchanges in xrs-7. In addition xrs-7 displayed a large increase in chromatid-type aberrations, particularly triradials. These X-ray-sensitive strains have previously been shown to have a defect in double-strand break rejoining (Kemp et al., 1984), and an increased number of double-strand breaks (DBSs) remain in their DNA after irradiation compared to wild-type cells. The increased number of DSBs remaining in these strains 20 min after irradiation, correlates well with the increase in chromosome breaks.},

Skin fibroblasts from the SENCAR mouse exposed during G2 phase to radiation associated with intracellular hydroxyl radical formation, i.e. X-rays or near UV/visible light, showed a higher frequency of chromatid breaks at 2 h post-irradiation than skin fibroblasts from six other inbred strains of mice including C3H/HeN. However the level was similar to that reported previously for the BALB/cAn mouse known to be resistant to chemical carcinogenesis of skin. When exposed for 2 h to visible light (8 W/m2), chromatid breaks persisted in fibroblasts from the SENCAR mouse during the 4 h post-irradiation period, but showed an abrupt decline in C3H/HeN fibroblasts within 1 h after irradiation. Skin fibroblasts from the tumor-sensitive SENCAR mouse differed from those of the resistant BALB/cAn in response to beta-cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) an inhibitor of the repair polymerase. Ara-C added to cultures of SENCAR and BALB/cAn cells after G2 X-irradiation (68R) increased chromatid gaps 18-fold and breaks 2-fold in BALB/cAn cells but had no effect on SENCAR cells even though incorporated into DNA to the same extent. The present results suggest that the SENCAR mouse is deficient in at least two aspects of DNA repair: (i) ligation or a prior step in the repair process leading to ligation and (ii) repair endonucleolytic incision at DNA lesions induced by irradiation.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Inherent and acquired cisplatin resistance reduces the effectiveness of this agent in the management of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying this process may result in the development of novel agents to enhance the sensitivity of cisplatin.
METHODS: An isogenic model of cisplatin resistance was generated in a panel of NSCLC cell lines (A549, SKMES-1, MOR, H460). Over a period of twelve months, cisplatin resistant (CisR) cell lines were derived from original, age-matched parent cells (PT) and subsequently characterized. Proliferation (MTT) and clonogenic survival assays (crystal violet) were carried out between PT and CisR cells. Cellular response to cisplatin-induced apoptosis and cell cycle distribution were examined by FACS analysis. A panel of cancer stem cell and pluripotent markers was examined in addition to the EMT proteins, c-Met and β-catenin. Cisplatin-DNA adduct formation, DNA damage (γH2AX) and cellular platinum uptake (ICP-MS) was also assessed.
RESULTS: Characterisation studies demonstrated a decreased proliferative capacity of lung tumour cells in response to cisplatin, increased resistance to cisplatin-induced cell death, accumulation of resistant cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and enhanced clonogenic survival ability. Moreover, resistant cells displayed a putative stem-like signature with increased expression of CD133+/CD44+cells and increased ALDH activity relative to their corresponding parental cells. The stem cell markers, Nanog, Oct-4 and SOX-2, were significantly upregulated as were the EMT markers, c-Met and β-catenin. While resistant sublines demonstrated decreased uptake of cisplatin in response to treatment, reduced cisplatin-GpG DNA adduct formation and significantly decreased γH2AX foci were observed compared to parental cell lines.
CONCLUSION: Our results identified cisplatin resistant subpopulations of NSCLC cells with a putative stem-like signature, providing a further understanding of the cellular events associated with the cisplatin resistance phenotype in lung cancer.},

	abstract = {Quantitative determination of the motility forces of chromosomes during cell division is fundamental to understanding a process that is universal among eukaryotic organisms. Using an optical tweezers system, isolated mammalian chromosomes were held in a 1064 nm laser trap. The minimum force required to move a single chromosome was determined to be ≈ 0.8-5 pN. The maximum transverse trapping efficiency of the isolated chromosomes was calculated as ≈ 0.01-0.02. These results confirm theoretical force calculations of ≈ 0.1-12 pN to move a chromosome on the mitotic or meiotic spindle. The verification of these results was carried out by calibration of the optical tweezers when trapping microspheres with a diameter of 4.5-15 µm in media with 1-7 cP viscosity. The results of the chromosome and microsphere trapping experiments agree with optical models developed to simulate trapping of cylindrical and spherical specimens.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Polar ejection forces have often been hypothesized to guide directional instability of mitotic chromosomes, but a direct link has never been established. This has led, in part, to the resurgence of alternative theories. By taking advantage of extremely precise femtosecond pulsed laser microsurgery, we abruptly alter the magnitude of polar ejection forces by severing vertebrate chromosome arms.
RESULTS: Reduction of polar ejection forces increases the amplitude of directional instability without altering other characteristics, thus establishing a direct link between polar ejection forces and the direction of chromosome movements. We find that polar ejection forces limit the range of chromosome oscillations by increasing the probability that motors at a leading kinetochore abruptly disengage or turn off, leading to a direction reversal.
CONCLUSIONS: From the relation between the change in oscillation amplitude and the amount a chromosome arm is shortened, we are able to map the distribution of polar ejection forces across the spindle, which is surprisingly different from previously assumed distributions. These results allow us to differentiate between the mechanisms proposed to underlie the directional instability of chromosomes.},

Because mutation is the ultimate source of the genetic variation required for adaptation, it can be appealing to suppose that the genomic mutation rate is adjusted to a level that best promotes adaptation. Most mutations with phenotypic effects are harmful, however, and thus there is relentless selection within populations for lower genomic mutation rates. Selection on beneficial mutations can counter this effect by favoring alleles that raise the mutation rate, but the effect of beneficial mutations on the genomic mutation rate is extremely sensitive to recombination and is unlikely to be important in sexual populations. In contrast, high genomic mutation rates can evolve in asexual populations under the influence of beneficial mutations, but this phenomenon is probably of limited adaptive significance and represents, at best, a temporary reprieve from the continual selection pressure to reduce mutation. The physiological cost of reducing mutation below the low level observed in most populations may be the most important factor in setting the genomic mutation rate in sexual and asexual systems, regardless of the benefits of mutation in producing new adaptive variation. Maintenance of mutation rates higher than the minimum set by this "cost of fidelity" is likely only under special circumstances.},

We found that genes with mammoth-specific amino acid changes are enriched in functions related to circadian biology, skin and hair development and physiology, lipid metabolism, adipose development and physiology, and temperature sensation. Finally, we resurrected and functionally tested the mammoth and ancestral elephant TRPV3 gene, which encodes a temperature-sensitive transient receptor potential (thermoTRP) channel involved in thermal sensation and hair growth, and we show that a single mammoth-specific amino acid substitution in an otherwise highly conserved region of the TRPV3 channel strongly affects its temperature sensitivity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: While large-scale cancer genomic projects are comprehensively characterizing the mutational spectrum of various cancers, so far little attention has been devoted to either define the antigenicity of these mutations or to characterize the immune responses they elicit. Here we present a strategy to characterize the immunophenotypes and the antigen-ome of human colorectal cancer.
RESULTS: We apply our strategy to a large colorectal cancer cohort (n = 598) and show that subpopulations of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are associated with distinct molecular phenotypes. The characterization of the antigenome shows that a large number of cancer-germline antigens are expressed in all patients. In contrast, neo-antigens are rarely shared between patients, indicating that cancer vaccination requires individualized strategy. Analysis of the genetic basis of the tumors reveals distinct tumor escape mechanisms for the patient subgroups. Hypermutated tumors are depleted of immunosuppressive cells and show upregulation of immunoinhibitory molecules. Non-hypermutated tumors are enriched with immunosuppressive cells, and the expression of immunoinhibitors and MHC molecules is downregulated. Reconstruction of the interaction network of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and immunomodulatory molecules followed by a validation with 11 independent cohorts (n = 1,945) identifies BCMA as a novel druggable target. Finally, linear regression modeling identifies major determinants of tumor immunogenicity, which include well-characterized modulators as well as a novel candidate, CCR8, which is then tested in an orthologous immunodeficient mouse model.
CONCLUSIONS: The immunophenotypes of the tumors and the cancer antigenome remain widely unexplored, and our findings represent a step toward the development of personalized cancer immunotherapies.},

	abstract = {Cancer immunoediting, the process by which the immune system controls tumour outgrowth and shapes tumour immunogenicity, is comprised of three phases: elimination, equilibrium and escape. Although many immune components that participate in this process are known, its underlying mechanisms remain poorly defined. A central tenet of cancer immunoediting is that T-cell recognition of tumour antigens drives the immunological destruction or sculpting of a developing cancer. However, our current understanding of tumour antigens comes largely from analyses of cancers that develop in immunocompetent hosts and thus may have already been edited. Little is known about the antigens expressed in nascent tumour cells, whether they are sufficient to induce protective antitumour immune responses or whether their expression is modulated by the immune system. Here, using massively parallel sequencing, we characterize expressed mutations in highly immunogenic methylcholanthrene-induced sarcomas derived from immunodeficient Rag2−/− mice that phenotypically resemble nascent primary tumour cells. Using class I prediction algorithms, we identify mutant spectrin-β2 as a potential rejection antigen of the d42m1 sarcoma and validate this prediction by conventional antigen expression cloning and detection. We also demonstrate that cancer immunoediting of d42m1 occurs via a T-cell-dependent immunoselection process that promotes outgrowth of pre-existing tumour cell clones lacking highly antigenic mutant spectrin-β2 and other potential strong antigens. These results demonstrate that the strong immunogenicity of an unedited tumour can be ascribed to expression of highly antigenic mutant proteins and show that outgrowth of tumour cells that lack these strong antigens via a T-cell-dependent immunoselection process represents one mechanism of cancer immunoediting.},

The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list—reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the “tumor microenvironment.” Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer.},

Cytotoxic and cytostatic effects of ionizing radiation, cisplatin, doxorubicin and taxol, administrated alone or in combination were investigated in vitro by flow cytometry.
RESULTS: A protective effect of doxorubicin but not cisplatin was found after administration of triple sequence with ionizing radiation and taxol. It was found that preliminary administration of doxorubicin induced growth arrest and protected A549 cells from the taxol/radiation treatment, while simultaneously killing FaDu and H1299 cells.
CONCLUSION: The proposed therapeutic strategy allows protection of p53 wild-type cells and selectively increases radiosensitivity of p53-deficient cancer cells.},

	doi = {10.1002/hed.20029},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The p53 protein, a well-known tumor suppressor that functions primarily as a transcription factor, initiates cell cycle arrest and apoptosis after genotoxic stress. The antiapoptotic regulator Bcl-2 is a downstream modulator of p53-induced apoptosis. Loss of function of the p53 tumor suppressor through mutation is an important event that contributes to cellular transformation. Mutation of p53 is one of the most common genetic alterations in squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (SCCHN). We hypothesized that p53 mutation is associated with Bcl-2 expression and susceptibility to apoptosis in SCCHN.
METHODS: Exons 5 to 8 of the p53 gene were sequenced in 22 SCCHN tumor samples and correlated with the Bcl-2 expression and apoptosis rates in these tumors. In addition, a Bcl-2-expressing SCCHN cell line, UMSCC74B, was stably transfected with a temperature-sensitive mutant p53 construct, and Bcl-2 expression levels were examined at the mutant and the wild-type temperatures.
RESULTS: Bcl-2 expression was inversely correlated with wild-type p53 status in SCCHN tumors (p = .05). Furthermore, there was a modest increase (1.7-fold) in apoptosis in the wild-type p53 tumors compared with mutant p53 SCCHN. Immunoblotting of UMSCC74B cells stably transfected with the temperature-sensitive mutant p53 construct demonstrated that shifting these cells to the mutant p53 temperature (39.5 degrees C) resulted in decreased expression of Bcl-2 compared with levels in cells grown at the wild-type p53 temperature (32.5 degrees C). Further investigation showed that SCCHN cells expressing predominantly mutant p53 and decreased Bcl-2 were more susceptible to cisplatin-induced apoptosis than vector-transfected controls (p {\textless} .0001).
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that p53 mutation directly modulates Bcl-2 expression and therefore susceptibility to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in SCCHN cells in vitro.},

We have conducted a pubmed search using the terms ‘metastatic pancreatic cancer’, ‘palliative chemotherapy’, ‘safety’ and ‘toxicity’. Our special focus rested on randomized phase III trials to provide readers with the highest level of available evidence.Expert opinion: The emergence of new and more effective chemotherapy regimens gives clinicians more freedom in the treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer. While being more effective, these regiments have a considerable degree of toxicity.

	abstract = {Background
An extensive literature has covered the statistical properties of the Continual Reassessment Method (CRM) and the modifications of this method. While there are some applications of CRM designs in recent Phase I trials, the standard method (SM) of escalating doses after three patients with an option for an additional three patients SM remains very popular, mainly due to its simplicity. From a practical perspective, clinicians are interested in designs that can estimate the MTD using fewer patients for a fixed number of doses, or can test more dose levels for a given sample size.

Purpose
This article compares CRM-based methods with the SM in terms of the number of patients needed to reach the MTD, total sample size required, and trial duration.

Methods
The comparisons are performed under two alternative schemes: a fixed or a varying sample approach with the implementation of a stopping rule. The stopping rule halts the trial if the confidence interval around the MTD is within a pre-specified bound. Our simulations evaluated several CRM-based methods under different scenarios by varying the number of dose levels from five to eight and the location of the true MTD.

Results
CRM and SM are comparable in terms of how fast they reach the MTD and the total sample size required when testing a limited number of dose levels (≤5), but as the number of dose levels increases, CRM reaches the MTD in fewer patients when used with a fixed sample of 20 patients. However, a sample size of 20–25 patients is not sufficient to achieve a narrow precision around the estimated toxicity rate at the MTD.

Limitations
We focused on methods with practical design features that are of interest to clinicians. However, there are several alternative CRM-based designs that are not investigated in this manuscript, and hence our results are not generalizable to other designs.

Conclusions
We show that CRM-based methods are an improvement over the SM in terms of accuracy and optimal dose allocation in almost all cases, except when the true dose is among the lower levels.},

	abstract = {Most patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) die from progressive disease after relapse, which is associated with clonal evolution at the cytogenetic level. To determine the mutational spectrum associated with relapse, we sequenced the primary tumour and relapse genomes from eight AML patients, and validated hundreds of somatic mutations using deep sequencing; this allowed us to define clonality and clonal evolution patterns precisely at relapse. In addition to discovering novel, recurrently mutated genes (for example, WAC, SMC3, DIS3, DDX41 and DAXX) in AML, we also found two major clonal evolution patterns during AML relapse: (1) the founding clone in the primary tumour gained mutations and evolved into the relapse clone, or (2) a subclone of the founding clone survived initial therapy, gained additional mutations and expanded at relapse. In all cases, chemotherapy failed to eradicate the founding clone. The comparison of relapse-specific versus primary tumour mutations in all eight cases revealed an increase in transversions, probably due to DNA damage caused by cytotoxic chemotherapy. These data demonstrate that AML relapse is associated with the addition of new mutations and clonal evolution, which is shaped, in part, by the chemotherapy that the patients receive to establish and maintain remissions.},

	abstract = {As tumors accumulate genetic alterations, an evolutionary process occurs in which genetically distinct subclonal populations of cells co-exist, resulting in intratumor genetic heterogeneity (ITH). The clinical implications of ITH remain poorly defined. Data are limited with respect to whether ITH is an independent determinant of patient survival outcomes, across different cancer types. Here, we report the results of a pan-cancer analysis of over 3300 tumors, showing a varied landscape of ITH across 9 cancer types. While some gene mutations are subclonal, the majority of driver gene mutations are clonal events, present in nearly all cancer cells. Strikingly, high levels of ITH are associated with poorer survival across diverse types of cancer. The adverse impact of high ITH is independent of other clinical, pathologic and molecular factors. High ITH tends to be associated with lower levels of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, but this association is not able to explain the observed survival differences. Together, these data show that ITH is a prognostic marker in multiple cancers. These results illuminate the natural history of cancer evolution, indicating that tumor heterogeneity represents a significant obstacle to cancer control.},

The study included 134 male volunteers, among whom 83 were occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation. Incidence of micronuclei and chromosomal aberration was assessed in lymphocytes. Total and reduced glutathione (GSH), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and lipid peroxidation were assessed in the plasma. The micronuclei frequency and chromosomal aberrations were significantly higher in the exposed group in comparison to the nonexposed group (P {\textless} 0.01-0.0001). Similarly, GSH, TAC, and SOD in the blood plasma were significantly higher in the exposed group than the nonexposed group (P {\textless} 0.01-0.0001). However, the level of malondialdehyde, which is an indicator of lipid peroxidation, did not differ significantly between both the groups. Importantly, radiation absorbed dose exhibited a positive correlation with the incidence of micronuclei in blood lymphocytes but not with chromosomal aberrations. This study shows that the susceptibility of peripheral blood lymphocytes to chromosomal damage is associated with plasma antioxidant levels. Furthermore, increased levels of blood plasma GSH, TAC, and SOD in occupationally exposed individuals could be an adaptive measure in response to oxidative stress to protect somatic cell genetic integrity.},

	abstract = {Although radiation carcinogenesis has been shown both experimentally and epidemiologically, the use of ionizing radiation is also one of the major modalities in cancer treatment. Various known cellular and molecular events are involved in carcinogenesis. Apart from the known phenomena, there could be implications for carcinogenesis and cancer prevention due to other biological processes such as the bystander effect, the abscopal effect, intrinsic radiosensitivity and radioadaptation. Bystander effects have consequences for mutation initiated cancer paradigms of radiation carcinogenesis, which provide the mechanistic justification for low-dose risk estimates. The abscopal effect is potentially important for tumor control and is mediated through cytokines and/or the immune system (mainly cell-mediated immunity). It results from loss of growth and stimulatory and/or immunosuppressive factors from the tumor. Intrinsic radiosensitivity is a feature of some cancer prone chromosomal breakage syndromes such as ataxia telangectiasia. Radiosensitivity is manifested as higher chromosomal aberrations and DNA repair impairment is now known as a good biomarker for breast cancer screening and prediction of prognosis. However, it is not yet known whether this effect is good or bad for those receiving radiation or radiomimetic agents for treatment. Radiation hormesis is another major concern for carcinogenesis. This process which protects cells from higher doses of radiation or radio mimic chemicals, may lead to the escape of cells from mitotic death or apoptosis and put cells with a lower amount of damage into the process of cancer induction. Therefore, any of these biological phenomena could have impact on another process giving rise to genome instability of cells which are not in the field of radiation but still receiving a lower amount of radiation. For prevention of radiation induced carcinogenesis or risk assessment as well as for successful radiation therapy, all these phenomena should be taken into account.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: Canfosfamide HCl (CAN) is a glutathione analogue prodrug that is activated by glutathione S-transferase P1-1 and induces apoptosis. CAN is synergistic in vitro with carboplatin, paclitaxel and anthracyclines.
METHODS: Patients with platinum-refractory or -resistant ovarian cancer (OC) who had progressed on second-line therapy with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) or topotecan (TOPO), were randomised between CAN 1000 mg/m(2) IV q 3 weeks or to either PLD 50mg/m(2) IV q 4 weeks or TOPO 1.5mg/m(2) IV d1-5 q 3 weeks.
RESULTS: About 461 patients were randomised after stratification for ECOG performance status, prior therapy, and bulky ({\textgreater}5 cm) disease. Groups were well balanced. In the control arm 58\% and 42\% were treated with PLD and TOPO, respectively. CAN was well tolerated with the most common grade 3-4 toxicities of 5\% anaemia, 4\% neutropaenia (no febrile neutropaenia), 4\% thrombocytopaenia, and 7\% vomiting. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were significantly higher in the control arm (p{\textless}0.001 and p{\textless}0.01, respectively). In a subgroup analysis PFS and OS tended to be higher with PLD than with TOPO.
CONCLUSION: CAN was well tolerated. This is the first randomised study showing an increased OS with third-line therapy. This might have important consequences for other recurrent OC trials.},

	abstract = {Aneuploidy, referring here to genome contents characterized by abnormal numbers of chromosomes, has been associated with developmental defects, cancer and adaptive evolution in experimental organisms. However, it remains unresolved how aneuploidy impacts gene expression and whether aneuploidy could directly bring about phenotypic variation and improved fitness over that of euploid counterparts. Here we show, using quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics and phenotypic profiling, that levels of protein expression in aneuploid yeast strains largely scale with chromosome copy numbers, following the same trend as that observed for the transcriptome, and that aneuploidy confers diverse phenotypes. We designed a novel scheme to generate, through random meiotic segregation, 38 stable and fully isogenic aneuploid yeast strains with distinct karyotypes and genome contents between 1N and 3N without involving any genetic selection. Through quantitative growth assays under various conditions or in the presence of a panel of chemotherapeutic or antifungal drugs, we found that some aneuploid strains grew significantly better than euploid control strains under conditions suboptimal for the latter. These results provide strong evidence that aneuploidy directly affects gene expression at both the transcriptome and proteome levels and can generate significant phenotypic variation that could bring about fitness gains under diverse conditions. Our findings suggest that the fitness ranking between euploid and aneuploid cells is dependent on context and karyotype, providing the basis for the notion that aneuploidy can directly underlie phenotypic evolution and cellular adaptation.},

The phenotypic diversity resulting from karyotypic diversity endows the cell population with superior adaptability. We show here, using a combination of experimental data and a general stochastic model, that the degree of phenotypic variation, thus evolvability, escalates with the degree of overall growth suppression. Such scaling likely explains the challenge of treating aneuploidy diseases with a single stress-inducing agent. Instead, we propose the design of an "evolutionary trap" (ET) targeting both karyotypic diversity and fitness. This strategy entails a selective condition "channeling" a karyotypically divergent population into one with a predominant and predictably drugable karyotypic feature. We provide a proof-of-principle case in budding yeast and demonstrate the potential efficacy of this strategy toward aneuploidy-based azole resistance in Candida albicans. By analyzing existing pharmacogenomics data, we propose the potential design of an ET against glioblastoma.},

	abstract = {Aneuploidy--the state of having uneven numbers of chromosomes--is a hallmark of cancer and a feature identified in yeast from diverse habitats. Recent studies have shown that aneuploidy is a form of large-effect mutation that is able to confer adaptive phenotypes under diverse stress conditions. Here we investigate whether pleiotropic stress could induce aneuploidy in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisae). We show that whereas diverse stress conditions can induce an increase in chromosome instability, proteotoxic stress, caused by transient Hsp90 (also known as Hsp82 or Hsc82) inhibition or heat shock, markedly increased chromosome instability to produce a cell population with high karyotype diversity. The induced chromosome instability is linked to an evolutionarily conserved role for the Hsp90 chaperone complex in kinetochore assembly. Continued growth in the presence of an Hsp90 inhibitor resulted in the emergence of drug-resistant colonies with chromosome XV gain. This drug-resistance phenotype is a quantitative trait involving copy number increases of at least two genes located on chromosome XV. Short-term exposure to Hsp90 stress potentiated fast adaptation to unrelated cytotoxic compounds by means of different aneuploid chromosome stoichiometries. These findings demonstrate that aneuploidy is a form of stress-inducible mutation in eukaryotes, capable of fuelling rapid phenotypic evolution and drug resistance, and reveal a new role for Hsp90 in regulating the emergence of adaptive traits under stress.},

	abstract = {Cancer progression is an example of a rapid adaptive process where evolving new traits is essential for survival and requires a high mutation rate. Precancerous cells acquire a few key mutations that drive rapid population growth and carcinogenesis. Cancer genomics demonstrates that these few driver mutations occur alongside thousands of random passenger mutations—a natural consequence of cancer’s elevated mutation rate. Some passengers are deleterious to cancer cells, yet have been largely ignored in cancer research. In population genetics, however, the accumulation of mildly deleterious mutations has been shown to cause population meltdown. Here we develop a stochastic population model where beneficial drivers engage in a tug-of-war with frequent mildly deleterious passengers. These passengers present a barrier to cancer progression describable by a critical population size, below which most lesions fail to progress, and a critical mutation rate, above which cancers melt down. We find support for this model in cancer age–incidence and cancer genomics data that also allow us to estimate the fitness advantage of drivers and fitness costs of passengers. We identify two regimes of adaptive evolutionary dynamics and use these regimes to understand successes and failures of different treatment strategies. A tumor’s load of deleterious passengers can explain previously paradoxical treatment outcomes and suggest that it could potentially serve as a biomarker of response to mutagenic therapies. The collective deleterious effect of passengers is currently an unexploited therapeutic target. We discuss how their effects might be exacerbated by current and future therapies.},

Studies have demonstrated that exposure to moderate-to-high levels can cause most forms of cancer, leukaemia and cancers of the breast, lung and thyroid being particularly sensitive to induction by radiation, especially at young ages at exposure. Predominant among these studies is the Life Span Study of the cohort of survivors of the atomic bombings of Japan in 1945, but substantial evidence is derived from groups exposed for medical reasons, occupationally or environmentally. Notable among these other groups are underground hard rock miners who inhaled radioactive radon gas and its decay products, large numbers of patients irradiated therapeutically and workers who received high doses in the nuclear weapons programme of the former USSR. The degree of carcinogenic risk arising from low levels of exposure is more contentious, but the available evidence points to an increased risk that is approximately proportional to the dose received. Epidemiological investigations of nonionizing radiation have established ultraviolet radiation as a cause of skin cancer. However, the evidence for a carcinogenic effect of other forms of nonionizing radiation, such as those associated with mobile telephones or electricity transmission lines, is not convincing, although the possibility of a link between childhood leukaemia and extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields cannot be dismissed entirely.},

To explore the genetic basis of relapse, we performed genome-wide DNA copy number analyses on matched diagnosis and relapse samples from 61 pediatric patients with ALL. The diagnosis and relapse samples typically showed different patterns of genomic copy number abnormalities (CNAs), with the CNAs acquired at relapse preferentially affecting genes implicated in cell cycle regulation and B cell development. Most relapse samples lacked some of the CNAs present at diagnosis, which suggests that the cells responsible for relapse are ancestral to the primary leukemia cells. Backtracking studies revealed that cells corresponding to the relapse clone were often present as minor subpopulations at diagnosis. These data suggest that genomic abnormalities contributing to ALL relapse are selected for during treatment, and they point to new targets for therapeutic intervention.},

	abstract = {The yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was used as a model to investigate theories of ploidy evolution. Mutagenesis experiments using the alkylating agent EMS (ethane methyl sulphonate) were conducted to assess the relative importance that masking of deleterious mutations has on response to and recovery from DNA damage. In particular, we tested whether cells with higher ploidy levels have relatively higher fitnesses after mutagenesis, whether the advantages of masking are more pronounced in tetraploids than in diploids, and whether purging of mutations allows more rapid recovery of haploid cells than cells with higher ploidy levels. Separate experiments were performed on asexually propagating stationary phase cells using (1) prototrophic haploid (MAT alpha) and diploid (MATa/alpha) strains and (2) isogenic haploid, diploid and tetraploid strains lacking a functional mating type locus. In both sets of experiments, haploids showed a more pronounced decrease in apparent growth rate than diploids, but both haploids and diploids appeared to recover very rapidly. Tetraploids did not show increased benefits of masking compared with diploids but volume measurements and FACScan analyses on the auxotrophic strains indicated that all treated tetraploid strains decreased in ploidy level and that some of the treated haploid lines increased in ploidy level. Results from these experiments confirm that while masking deleterious mutations provides an immediate advantage to higher ploidy levels in the presence of mutagens, selection is extremely efficient at removing induced mutations, leading growth rates to increase rapidly over time at all ploidy levels. Furthermore, ploidy level is itself a mutable trait in the presence of EMS, with both haploids and tetraploids often evolving towards diploidy (the ancestral state of S. cerevisiae) during the course of the experiment.},

To examine this hypothesis we study shape characteristics of paired osteosarcoma cell lines, each consisting of a less metastatic parental line and a more metastatic line, derived from the former by in vivo selection. Two-dimensional images of four pairs of lines were processed. Statistical analysis of morphometric characteristics shows that shape characteristics of the metastatic cell line are partly overlapping and partly diverged from the parental line. Significantly, the shape changes fall into two categories, with three paired cell lines displaying a more mesenchymal-like morphology, while the fourth displaying a change towards a more rounded morphology. A neural network algorithm could distinguish between samples of the less metastatic cells from the more metastatic cells with near perfect accuracy.

Such cases present diagnostic pitfalls, especially with regard to the differential diagnosis from follicular hyperplasia and marginal zone B-cell lymphoma. Therefore, we also included an immunohistochemical evaluation of stathmin, which is strongly expressed by germinal centre B cells, as a putative new marker for follicular lymphomas, particularly those with an atypical phenotype.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Two hundred and five follicular lymphomas were investigated with immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH). The use of three distinct anti-bcl-2 antibodies together with CD10 expression data and FISH analysis for bcl-2 and bcl-6 rearrangements allowed subclassification of follicular lymphoma into four distinct subgroups: (i) CD10-positive/bcl-2-positive, (ii) CD10-positive/bcl-2-negative, (iii) CD10-negative/bcl-2-positive, and (iv) CD10-negative/bcl-2-negative. All cases were bcl-6-positive. STMN1 (stathmin) was shown to be helpful in diagnosing bcl-2-negative and/or CD10-negative follicular lymphomas, and in their distinction from marginal zone B-cell lymphoma.
CONCLUSIONS: Combined immunohistological and molecular analyses reveal that follicular lymphomas showing an atypical immunophenotypic and molecular profile exist, and we demonstrate that STMN1 represents a novel useful diagnostic marker for these.},

We identified modules of highly coexpressed genes, some of which are restricted to a single lineage but most of which are expressed at variable levels across multiple lineages. We found densely interconnected cis-regulatory circuits and a large number of transcription factors that are differentially expressed across hematopoietic states.

A fundamental research problem in many RNA-seq studies is the identification of reliable molecular markers that show differential expression between distinct sample groups. Together with the growing popularity of RNA-seq, a number of data analysis methods and pipelines have already been developed for this task. Currently, however, there is no clear consensus about the best practices yet, which makes the choice of an appropriate method a daunting task especially for a basic user without a strong statistical or computational background. To assist the choice, we perform here a systematic comparison of eight widely used software packages and pipelines for detecting differential expression between sample groups in a practical research setting and provide general guidelines for choosing a robust pipeline. In general, our results demonstrate how the data analysis tool utilized can markedly affect the outcome of the data analysis, highlighting the importance of this choice.},

We developed ultra high-sensitivity multiplex digital polymerase chain reaction assays for ESR1 mutations in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and investigated the clinical relevance and origin of ESR1 mutations in 171 women with advanced breast cancer. ESR1 mutation status in ctDNA showed high concordance with contemporaneous tumor biopsies and was accurately assessed in samples shipped at room temperature in preservative tubes. ESR1 mutations were found exclusively in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients previously exposed to AI. Patients with ESR1 mutations had a substantially shorter progression-free survival on subsequent AI-based therapy [hazard ratio, 3.1; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.9 to 23.1; P = 0.0041]. ESR1 mutation prevalence differed markedly between patients who were first exposed to AI during the adjuvant and metastatic settings [5.8\% (3 of 52) versus 36.4\% (16 of 44), respectively; P = 0.0002]. In an independent cohort, ESR1 mutations were identified in 0\% (0 of 32; 95\% CI, 0 to 10.9) tumor biopsies taken after progression on adjuvant AI. In a patient with serial sampling, ESR1 mutation was selected during metastatic AI therapy to become the dominant clone in the cancer. ESR1 mutations can be robustly identified with ctDNA analysis and predict for resistance to subsequent AI therapy. ESR1 mutations are rarely acquired during adjuvant AI but are commonly selected by therapy for metastatic disease, providing evidence that mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapy may be substantially different between the treatment of micrometastatic and overt metastatic cancer.},

Similarly, confocal microscopy in three human cell lines detected expression of more than 70\% of the analyzed proteins.

	abstract = {Histology of malignant glioma depicts dense proliferative areas rich in angiogenesis as well as dissemination of neoplastic cells into adjacent brain tissue. Although the mechanisms that trigger transition from proliferative to invasive phenotypes are complex, the dichotomy of cell proliferation and migration, the “Go or Grow” hypothesis, argues for specific and coordinated regulation of these phenotypes. We investigated transcriptional elements that accompany the phenotypes of migration and proliferation, and consider the therapeutic significance of the “Go or Grow” hypothesis. Interrogation of matched core and rim regions from human glioblastoma biopsy specimens in situ (n = 44) revealed higher proliferation (Ki67 labeling index) in cells residing at the core compared to the rim. Profiling activated transcription factors in a panel of migration-activated versus migration-restricted GBM cells portrayed strong NF-κB activity in the migratory cell population. In contrast, increased c-Myc activity was found in migration-restricted proliferative cells. Validation of transcriptional activity by NF-κB- or c-Myc-driven GFP or RFP, respectively, showed an increased NF-κB activity in the active migrating cells, whereas the proliferative, migration restricted cells displayed increased c-Myc activity. Immunohistochemistry on clinical specimens validated a robust phosphorylated c-Myc staining in tumor cells at the core, whereas increased phosphorylated NF-κB staining was detected in the invasive tumor cells at the rim. Functional genomics revealed that depletion of c-Myc expression by siRNA oligonucleotides reduced cell proliferation in vitro, but surprisingly, cell migration was enhanced significantly. Conversely, inhibition of NF-κB by pharmacological inhibitors, SN50 or BAY-11, decreased both cell migration in vitro and invasion ex vivo. Notably, inhibition of NF-κB was found to have no effect on the proliferation rate of glioma cells. These findings suggest that the reciprocal and coordinated suppression/activation of transcription factors, such as c-Myc and NF-κB may underlie the shift of glioma cells from a “growing-to-going” phenotype.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) the initial response to chemotherapy is often favorable, but relapse and chemotherapy resistance frequently occur in advanced disease. Hence there is an urgent need for targeted treatments in this breast cancer subtype. In the current study we deep sequenced DNA of tumors prior to chemotherapy to search for predictors of response or resistance.
METHODS: Next generation sequencing (NGS) was performed for 1,977 genes involved in tumorigenesis. DNA from 56 pre-treatment TNBC-biopsies was sequenced, as well as matched normal DNA. Following their tumor biopsy, patients started neoadjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. We studied associations between genetic alterations and three clinical variables: chemotherapy response, relapse-free survival and BRCA proficiency.
RESULTS: The mutations observed were diverse and few recurrent mutations were detected. Most mutations were in TP53, TTN, and PIK3CA (55 \%, 14 \%, and 9 \%, respectively). The mutation rates were similar between responders and non-responders (average mutation rate 9 vs 8 mutations). No recurrent mutations were associated with chemotherapy response or relapse. Interestingly, PIK3CA mutations were exclusively observed in patients proficient for BRCA1. Samples with a relapse had a higher copy number alteration rate, and amplifications of TTK and TP53BP2 were associated with a poor chemotherapy response.
CONCLUSIONS: In this homogenous cohort of TNBCs few recurrent mutations were found. However, PIK3CA mutations were associated with BRCA proficiency, which can have clinical consequences in the near future.},

This study examines the genetic events initiating leukemia and details the clinical progression of disease across multiple families harboring germ-line CEBPA mutations. Clinical data were collected from 10 CEBPA-mutated families, representing 24 members with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Whole-exome (WES) and deep sequencing were performed to genetically profile tumors and define patterns of clonal evolution. Germline CEBPA mutations clustered within the N-terminal and were highly penetrant, with AML presenting at a median age of 24.5 years (range, 1.75-46 years). In all diagnostic tumors tested (n = 18), double CEBPA mutations (CEBPAdm) were detected, with acquired (somatic) mutations preferentially targeting the C-terminal. Somatic CEBPA mutations were unstable throughout the disease course, with different mutations identified at recurrence. Deep sequencing of diagnostic and relapse paired samples confirmed that relapse-associated CEBPA mutations were absent at diagnosis, suggesting recurrence was triggered by novel, independent clones. Integrated WES and deep sequencing subsequently revealed an entirely new complement of mutations at relapse, verifying the presentation of a de novo leukemic episode. The cumulative incidence of relapse in familial AML was 56\% at 10 years (n = 11), and 3 patients experienced ≥3 disease episodes over a period of 17 to 20 years. Durable responses to secondary therapies were observed, with prolonged median survival after relapse (8 years) and long-term overall survival (10-year overall survival, 67\%). Our data reveal that familial CEBPA-mutated AML exhibits a unique model of disease progression, associated with favorable long-term outcomes.},

MPNSTs with PRC2 loss showed complete loss of trimethylation at lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3) and aberrant transcriptional activation of multiple PRC2-repressed homeobox master regulators and their regulated developmental pathways. Introduction of the lost PRC2 component in a PRC2-deficient MPNST cell line restored H3K27me3 levels and decreased cell growth. Additionally, we identified frequent somatic alterations of CDKN2A (81\% of all MPNSTs) and NF1 (72\% of non-NF1-associated MPNSTs), both of which significantly co-occur with PRC2 alterations.

	doi = {10.1186/s13058-015-0638-4},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Abundance of immune cells has been shown to have prognostic and predictive significance in many tumor types. Beyond abundance, the spatial organization of immune cells in relation to cancer cells may also have significant functional and clinical implications. However there is a lack of systematic methods to quantify spatial associations between immune and cancer cells.
METHODS: We applied ecological measures of species interactions to digital pathology images for investigating the spatial associations of immune and cancer cells in breast cancer. We used the Morisita-Horn similarity index, an ecological measure of community structure and predator-prey interactions, to quantify the extent to which cancer cells and immune cells colocalize in whole-tumor histology sections. We related this index to disease-specific survival of 486 women with breast cancer and validated our findings in a set of 516 patients from different hospitals.
RESULTS: Colocalization of immune cells with cancer cells was significantly associated with a disease-specific survival benefit for all breast cancers combined. In HER2-positive subtypes, the prognostic value of immune-cancer cell colocalization was highly significant and exceeded those of known clinical variables. Furthermore, colocalization was a significant predictive factor for long-term outcome following chemotherapy and radiotherapy in HER2 and Luminal A subtypes, independent of and stronger than all known clinical variables.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates how ecological methods applied to the tumor microenvironment using routine histology can provide reproducible, quantitative biomarkers for identifying high-risk breast cancer patients. We found that the clinical value of immune-cancer interaction patterns is highly subtype-specific but substantial and independent to known clinicopathologic variables that mostly focused on cancer itself. Our approach can be developed into computer-assisted prediction based on histology samples that are already routinely collected.},

It has proven to be efficient in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia and also in other malignancies that involve expression of a tyrosine kinase. However, some patients can develop resistance and others suffer from toxic side effects. The pharmacokinetics of IM depends on several enzymes and transporters, and several studies have attempted to identify genetic factors associated with variable drug levels and clinical responses using a candidate gene approach. Larger and more homogenous studies are still needed to replicate the findings obtained so far, or to analyze other genetic variations to get clearer insights into how IM treatment can be tailored to each patient's genetics. Here we summarize pharmacogenetic studies of IM and highlight the genetic markers that could be used to improve the treatment and management of diseases for which IM is used.},

	abstract = {Over the past few years, new high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies have dramatically increased speed and reduced sequencing costs. However, the use of these sequencing technologies is often challenged by errors and biases associated with the bioinformatical methods used for analyzing the data. In particular, the use of naïve methods to identify polymorphic sites and infer genotypes can inflate downstream analyses. Recently, explicit modeling of genotype probability distributions has been proposed as a method for taking genotype call uncertainty into account. Based on this idea, we propose a novel method for quantifying population genetic differentiation from next-generation sequencing data. In addition, we present a strategy for investigating population structure via principal components analysis. Through extensive simulations, we compare the new method herein proposed to approaches based on genotype calling and demonstrate a marked improvement in estimation accuracy for a wide range of conditions. We apply the method to a large-scale genomic data set of domesticated and wild silkworms sequenced at low coverage. We find that we can infer the fine-scale genetic structure of the sampled individuals, suggesting that employing this new method is useful for investigating the genetic relationships of populations sampled at low coverage.},

Demographic processes (e.g., bottleneck and expansion) and spatial structure (e.g., migration, number, and size of populations) are known to shape the patterns of the genetic diversity of populations. However, the impact of temporal changes in migration on genetic diversity has seldom been considered, although such events might be the norm. Indeed, during the millions of years of a species’ lifetime, repeated isolation and reconnection of populations occur. Geological and climatic events alternately isolate and reconnect habitats. We analytically document the dynamics of genetic diversity after an abrupt change in migration given the mutation rate and the number and sizes of the populations. We demonstrate that during transient dynamics, genetic diversity can reach unexpectedly high values that can be maintained over thousands of generations. We discuss the consequences of such processes for the evolution of species based on standing genetic variation and how they can affect the reconstruction of a population’s demographic and evolutionary history from genetic data. Our results also provide guidelines for the use of genetic data for the conservation of natural populations.},

	abstract = {Based on recent studies in single-celled organisms, it has been argued that a fitness benefit associated with a mutation will increase the probability of that mutation occurring. This increase is independent of mutation rates at other loci and is called adaptive mutagenesis. We modeled the effect of adaptive mutagenesis on populations of haploid organisms with adaptive mutation rates ranging from 0 to 1 X 10(-5). Allele frequencies at the selected locus and a neutral linked locus were tracked. We also observed the amount of linkage disequilibrium during the selective sweep and the final heterozygosity after the sweep. The presence of adaptive mutagenesis increases the number of genetic backgrounds carrying the new fitter allele, making the outcomes more representative of the population before the selection. Therefore, more neutral genetic variation is preserved in simulations with adaptive mutagenesis than in those without it due to hitchhiking. Since adaptive mutagenesis is time-dependent, it can generate mutants when other mechanisms of mutation cannot. In addition, adaptive mutagenesis has the potential to confound both phylogeny construction and the detection of natural selection from patterns of nucleotide variation.},

Cell function may be described as producing progression or regression, often found as alternating features in tumors or as variations between normal tissues and tumors. The source of regression in normal melanin producing cells may not be the same as in melanomas. These functions of living matter persist in all phyla of eumetazoans vascular plants as well as in particular species of fungi.

We show that lentiviral delivery of a genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout (GeCKO) library targeting 18,080 genes with 64,751 unique guide sequences enables both negative and positive selection screening in human cells. First, we used the GeCKO library to identify genes essential for cell viability in cancer and pluripotent stem cells. Next, in a melanoma model, we screened for genes whose loss is involved in resistance to vemurafenib, a therapeutic RAF inhibitor. Our highest-ranking candidates include previously validated genes NF1 and MED12, as well as novel hits NF2, CUL3, TADA2B, and TADA1. We observe a high level of consistency between independent guide RNAs targeting the same gene and a high rate of hit confirmation, demonstrating the promise of genome-scale screening with Cas9.
Improving Whole-Genome Screens
Improved methods are needed for the knockout of individual genes in genome-scale functional screens. Wang et al. (p. 80, published online 12 December) and Shalem et al. (p. 84, published online 12 December) used the bacterial CRISPR/Cas9 system to power-screen protocols that avoid several of the pitfalls associated with small interfering RNA (siRNA) screens. Genome editing by these methods completely disrupts target genes, thus avoiding weak signals that can occur when transcript abundance is partially decreased by siRNA. Furthermore, gene targeting by the CRISPR system is more precise and appears to produce substantially fewer off-target effects than existing methods.},

Here we describe the generation and characterization of iPSCs derived from human chronic myeloid leukemia cells. We show that, despite the presence of oncogenic mutations, these cells acquired pluripotency by the expression of 4 transcription factors and underwent differentiation into cell types derived of all 3 germ layers during teratoma formation. Interestingly, although the parental cell line was strictly dependent on continuous signaling of the BCR-ABL oncogene, also termed oncogene addiction, reprogrammed cells lost this dependency and became resistant to the BCR-ABL inhibitor imatinib. This finding indicates that the therapeutic agent imatinib targets cells in a specific epigenetic differentiated cell state, and this may contribute to its inability to fully eradicate disease in chronic myeloid leukemia patients.},

	issn = {0250-7005},
	abstract = {Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) secreted from the prostate stroma mediates tumor-stromal cell interactions in prostate cancer development. We have recently reported that human prostate stromal cells (PrSC) stimulate human prostate cancer DU-145 cell growth via IGF-I. Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) also plays a critical role in tumor-stromal cell interactions, but TGF-beta1 has pleiotropic effects as it can modulate growth of prostate cancer either positively or negatively. To elucidate the complex behavior of TGF-beta1, the effect of TGF-beta1 on the IGF axis in PrSC was studied. TGF-beta1 increased the expression of IGF-I and IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3). RT-PCR experiments revealed that TGF-beta1 upregulated the mRNA expression of IGF-I and IGFBP-3. However, while TGF-beta1 significantly increased IGFBP-3 secretion by PrSC, it conversely reduced the amounts of biologically active IGF-I unbound to IGFBP-3. Immunohistochemical analyses of 49 human prostate cancer tissues showed that IGF-I expression in the stroma correlated positively with TGF-beta1 expression in the stroma (r = 0.551, p = 0.0001). Furthermore, TGF-beta1 actually suppressed the growth of DU-145 cells in coculture with PrSC. But, IGFBP-3 proteinases, such as prostate specific antigen (PSA) and matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7), restored the DU-145 cell growth, suggesting that degradation of IGFBP-3 potentiates cancer growth. Taken together, these results indicated that TGF-beta1 modulates the growth of prostate cancer, either positively or negatively, through the balance between the amounts of IGF-I and IGFBP-3. This complex behavior of TGF-beta1 on the IGF axis is one explanation for the pleiotropic activities of TGF-beta1 on the growth of prostate cancer.},

Gastric cancer is a very complex and heterogeneous disease, and although much has been learned about the different genetic changes that eventually lead to its development, the detailed mechanisms still remain unclear. Malignant transformation of gastric cells is the consequence of a multistep process involving different genetic and epigenetic changes in numerous genes in combination with host genetic background and environmental factors. The majority of gastric adenocarcinomas are characterized by genetic instability, either microsatellite instability (MSI) or chromosomal instability (CIN). It is believed that chromosome destabilizations occur early in tumour progression.

	abstract = {Recent studies using the isolation of a subpopulation of tumour cells followed by their transplantation into immunodeficient mice provide evidence that certain tumours, including squamous skin tumours, contain cells with high clonogenic potential that have been referred to as cancer stem cells (CSCs). Until now, CSC properties have only been investigated by transplantation assays, and their existence in unperturbed tumour growth is unproven. Here we make use of clonal analysis of squamous skin tumours using genetic lineage tracing to unravel the mode of tumour growth in vivo in its native environment. To this end, we used a genetic labelling strategy that allows individual tumour cells to be marked and traced over time at different stages of tumour progression. Surprisingly, we found that the majority of labelled tumour cells in benign papilloma have only limited proliferative potential, whereas a fraction has the capacity to persist long term, giving rise to progeny that occupy a significant part of the tumour. As well as confirming the presence of two distinct proliferative cell compartments within the papilloma, mirroring the composition, hierarchy and fate behaviour of normal tissue, quantitative analysis of clonal fate data indicates that the more persistent population has stem-cell-like characteristics and cycles twice per day, whereas the second represents a slower cycling transient population that gives rise to terminally differentiated tumour cells. Such behaviour is shown to be consistent with double-labelling experiments and detailed clonal fate characteristics. By contrast, measurements of clone size and proliferative potential in invasive squamous cell carcinoma show a different pattern of behaviour, consistent with geometric expansion of a single CSC population with limited potential for terminal differentiation. This study presents the first experimental evidence for the existence of CSCs during unperturbed solid tumour growth.},

	abstract = {In previous studies, we have shown that numbers of S100 calcium-binding proteins (including S100A4) are expressed differentially in astrocytic tumors according to their levels of malignancy. S100A4 is involved in tumor progression, cell migration and metastasis. This protein is able to play extracellular roles such as neuritogenic and angiogenic activities. The present study aims to investigate the possible role played by extracellular S100A4 in the in vitro migration of astrocytic tumor cells. The speed and rate of migration of living cells were measured using computer-assisted videomicroscopy. In parallel, we also analyzed the effects of extracellular S100A4 on the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and the expression of a number of its molecular regulators. These included small Rho-GTPases (RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42) and some of their direct effectors (mDia and N-WASP), and also actin-binding proteins such as profilin and alpha-actinin. Our data demonstrate the influence of S100A4 on astrocytic tumor cells with respect to these different aspects. Indeed, we show that extracellular S100A4 treatments decrease both the amount of polymerized F-actin and the levels of expression of RhoA, mDia and profilin. While a decrease in the Cdc42 and N-WASP expression was also observed, the Rac1 expression remained unchanged. All these activities, which result in the stimulation of cell motility, contribute to the understanding of the extracellular role of S100A4.},

AGEs may be generated rapidly or over long times stimulated by a range of distinct triggering mechanisms, thereby accounting for their roles in multiple settings and disease states. A critical property of AGEs is their ability to activate receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), a signal transduction receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily. It is our hypothesis that due to such interaction, AGEs impart a potent impact in tissues, stimulating processes linked to inflammation and its consequences. We hypothesize that AGEs cause perturbation in a diverse group of diseases, such as diabetes, inflammation, neurodegeneration, and aging. Thus, we propose that targeting this pathway may represent a logical step in the prevention/treatment of the sequelae of these disorders.},

	abstract = {BackgroundGlioblastoma multiforme (GBM) contains a population of cells that exhibit stem cell phenotypes. These cancer stem cells (CSCs) may be a source of therapeutic resistance, although support for this important concept is limited.MethodsWe determined whether early-passage GBM CSCs respond differently than patient-matched, genotypically similar non-CSCs to clinically relevant single or serial doses of temozolomide (TMZ), radiation therapy (XRT), or alternating TMZ treatment and XRT, which is the standard of care for GBM patients.ResultsDespite the phenotypic differences, including the presence of stem cell markers and formation of intracranial tumors, the CSCs and matched non-CSCs were equally resistant to TMZ in a majority of patients, using 2 independent assays. TMZ response was consistent with methylated O(6)-DNA methylguanine-methyltransferase (MGMT) and MGMT protein levels in both culture types. In contrast, CSCs were unexpectedly more responsive to XRT compared with matched non-CSCs from 2 patients despite having relatively equal resistance to TMZ. However, for the majority of culture pairs from individual patients, responses in CSCs were indistinguishable from non-CSC cultures.ConclusionsIn our patient-matched primary cultures, response to TMZ was tightly linked to the individual tumor's MGMT status and independent of their phenotypic differences. TMZ and XRT together revealed no additive benefit compared with monotherapy for either culture type, in contrast to the notion that the CSC population is more resistant to XRT. If the tumor cell response in vitro mirrors therapeutic response in larger patient cohorts, these rapid assays in primary cultures could allow -empirical selection of efficacious therapeutic agents on a patient-specific basis.},

	abstract = {The recent identification of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in multiple human cancers provides a new inroad to understanding tumorigenesis at the cellular level. CSCs are defined by their characteristics of self-renewal, multipotentiality, and tumor initiation upon transplantation. By testing for these defining characteristics, we provide evidence for the existence of CSCs in a transgenic mouse model of glioma, S100beta-verbB;Trp53. In this glioma model, CSCs are enriched in the side population (SP) cells. These SP cells have enhanced tumor-initiating capacity, self-renewal, and multipotentiality compared with non-SP cells from the same tumors. Furthermore, gene expression analysis comparing fluorescence-activated cell sorting-sorted cancer SP cells to non-SP cancer cells and normal neural SP cells identified 45 candidate genes that are differentially expressed in glioma stem cells. We validated the expression of two genes from this list (S100a4 and S100a6) in primary mouse gliomas and human glioma samples. Analyses of xenografted human glioblastoma multiforme cell lines and primary human glioma tissues show that S100A4 and S100A6 are expressed in a small subset of cancer cells and that their abundance is positively correlated to tumor grade. In conclusion, this study shows that CSCs exist in a mouse glioma model, suggesting that this model can be used to study the molecular and cellular characteristics of CSCs in vivo and to further test the CSC hypothesis.},

	abstract = {The cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis suggests that neoplastic clones are maintained exclusively by a rare fraction of cells with stem cell properties. Although the existence of CSCs in human leukaemia is established, little evidence exists for CSCs in solid tumours, except for breast cancer. Recently, we prospectively isolated a CD133+ cell subpopulation from human brain tumours that exhibited stem cell properties in vitro. However, the true measures of CSCs are their capacity for self renewal and exact recapitulation of the original tumour. Here we report the development of a xenograft assay that identified human brain tumour initiating cells that initiate tumours in vivo. Only the CD133+ brain tumour fraction contains cells that are capable of tumour initiation in NOD-SCID (non-obese diabetic, severe combined immunodeficient) mouse brains. Injection of as few as 100 CD133+ cells produced a tumour that could be serially transplanted and was a phenocopy of the patient's original tumour, whereas injection of 10(5) CD133- cells engrafted but did not cause a tumour. Thus, the identification of brain tumour initiating cells provides insights into human brain tumour pathogenesis, giving strong support for the CSC hypothesis as the basis for many solid tumours, and establishes a previously unidentified cellular target for more effective cancer therapies.},

	abstract = {Both genome-wide genetic and epigenetic alterations are fundamentally important for the development of cancers, but the interdependence of these aberrations is poorly understood. Glioblastomas and other cancers with the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) constitute a subset of tumours with extensive epigenomic aberrations and a distinct biology. Glioma CIMP (G-CIMP) is a powerful determinant of tumour pathogenicity, but the molecular basis of G-CIMP remains unresolved. Here we show that mutation of a single gene, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), establishes G-CIMP by remodelling the methylome. This remodelling results in reorganization of the methylome and transcriptome. Examination of the epigenome of a large set of intermediate-grade gliomas demonstrates a distinct G-CIMP phenotype that is highly dependent on the presence of IDH mutation. Introduction of mutant IDH1 into primary human astrocytes alters specific histone marks, induces extensive DNA hypermethylation, and reshapes the methylome in a fashion that mirrors the changes observed in G-CIMP-positive lower-grade gliomas. Furthermore, the epigenomic alterations resulting from mutant IDH1 activate key gene expression programs, characterize G-CIMP-positive proneural glioblastomas but not other glioblastomas, and are predictive of improved survival. Our findings demonstrate that IDH mutation is the molecular basis of CIMP in gliomas, provide a framework for understanding oncogenesis in these gliomas, and highlight the interplay between genomic and epigenomic changes in human cancers.},

HSP stimulate macrophages to secrete cytokines, and induce expression of antigen-presenting and co-stimulatory molecules on the DC. The HSP gp96 and hsp70 act differentially, and each induces some but not all molecules. HSP interact with these antigen-presenting cells through the highly conserved NF-κB pathway. As HSP are intracellular, abundant and soluble, their presence in the extra-cellular milieu and the consequent activation of antigen-presenting cells (APC) constitutes an excellent mechanism for response to cell death. As HSP are conserved from bacteria to mammals, the ability of HSP to activate APC provides a unified mechanism for response to internal and external stimuli.},

We identified 1,801 adult patients with unilateral clear cell renal cell carcinoma treated with radical nephrectomy between 1970 and 1998. Clinical features examined included age, sex, smoking history, and signs and symptoms at presentation. Pathological features examined included 1997 TNM stage, tumor size, nuclear grade, histological tumor necrosis, sarcomatoid component, cystic architecture, multifocality and surgical margin status. Cancer specific survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to test associations between features studied and outcome. The selection of features included in the multivariate model was validated using bootstrap methodology.
Mean followup was 9.7 years (range 0.1 to 31). Estimated cancer specific survival rates at 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 years were 86.6\%, 74.0\%, 68.7\%, 63.8\% and 60.0\%, respectively.

	abstract = {hSNF5, the smallest member of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, is lost in most malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRT). In MRT cell lines, reexpression of hSNF5 induces G1 cell cycle arrest, elevated p16INK4a, and activated replicative senescence markers, such as beta-galactosidase (beta-Gal) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. To compare the replicative senescence caused by hSNF5 in A204 cells to normal cellular senescence, we examined the activation of both p16INK4a and p21CIP/WAF1. Analogous to normal cellular senescence, both p16INK4a and p21CIP/WAF1 were up-regulated following hSNF5 restoration. Furthermore, we found that hSNF5 bound the p16INK4a and p21CIP/WAF1 promoters, suggesting that it directly regulates transcription of these genes. Using p16INK4a RNA interference, we showed its requirement for the replicative senescence caused by hSNF5 but not the growth arrest. Instead, p21CIP/WAF1 remained activated by hSNF5 in the absence of high p16INK4a expression, apparently causing the growth arrest in A204. Interestingly, we also found that, in the absence of p16INK4a, reexpression of hSNF5 also increased protein levels of a second cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, p18INK4c. However, our data show that lack of hSNF5 does not abrogate cellular responsiveness to DNA damage or growth-inhibitory factors. In summary, our studies suggest that hSNF5 loss may influence the regulation of multiple CDK inhibitors involved in replicative senescence.},

	abstract = {Medulloblastoma is frequently disseminated throughout the central nervous system by the time of diagnosis. Conventional therapeutic approaches have not reduced the high mortality associated with metastatic medulloblastoma and little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms that promote tumor invasion. Previously, we reported that overexpression of ERBB2 in medulloblastoma is associated with poor prognosis and metastasis. Here, we demonstrate that ERBB2 overexpression increases the migration of medulloblastoma cells across basement membranes in vitro. Furthermore, using microarray expression profiling, we show that ERBB2 up-regulates the expression of prometastatic genes in medulloblastoma cells. These include S100A4, which was previously shown to promote metastasis of breast cancer. We demonstrate that S100A4 is a direct target of ERBB2 signaling in medulloblastoma cells via a pathway involving phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, AKT1, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and that levels of ERBB2 and S100A4 are tightly correlated in samples of primary medulloblastoma. Finally, we show that ERBB2-dependent medulloblastoma cell invasion in vitro and prometastatic gene expression in vivo can be blocked using the ERBB tyrosine kinase inhibitor OSI-774. These data identify an ERBB2 driven prometastatic pathway that may provide a novel target for therapeutic intervention in metastatic medulloblastoma.},

So far, over 2,300, 500, and 80 Alu, L1, and SVA insertions, respectively, have been reported to be polymorphic and many more are yet to be discovered. We present here the Database of Retrotransposon Insertion Polymorphisms (dbRIP; http://falcon.roswellpark.org:9090), a highly integrated and interactive database of human retrotransposon insertion polymorphisms (RIPs). dbRIP currently contains a nonredundant list of 1,625, 407, and 63 polymorphic Alu, L1, and SVA elements, respectively, or a total of 2,095 RIPs. In dbRIP, we deploy the utilities and annotated data of the genome browser developed at the University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC) for user-friendly queries and integrative browsing of RIPs along with all other genome annotation information. Users can query the database by a variety of means and have access to the detailed information related to a RIP, including detailed insertion sequences and genotype data. dbRIP represents the first database providing comprehensive, integrative, and interactive compilation of RIP data, and it will be a useful resource for researchers working in the area of human genetics.},

Telomerase products with a five nucleotide periodicity were generated. High telomerase activities were detected in all lobster organs.

	abstract = {We propose an improved version of the neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm of Saitou and Nei. This new algorithm, BIONJ, follows the same agglomerative scheme as NJ, which consists of iteratively picking a pair of taxa, creating a new mode which represents the cluster of these taxa, and reducing the distance matrix by replacing both taxa by this node. Moreover, BIONJ uses a simple first-order model of the variances and covariances of evolutionary distance estimates. This model is well adapted when these estimates are obtained from aligned sequences. At each step it permits the selection, from the class of admissible reductions, of the reduction which minimizes the variance of the new distance matrix. In this way, we obtain better estimates to choose the pair of taxa to be agglomerated during the next steps. Moreover, in comparison with NJ's estimates, these estimates become better and better as the algorithm proceeds. BIONJ retains the good properties of NJ--especially its low run time. Computer simulations have been performed with 12-taxon model trees to determine BIONJ's efficiency. When the substitution rates are low (maximum pairwise divergence approximately 0.1 substitutions per site) or when they are constant among lineages, BIONJ is only slightly better than NJ. When the substitution rates are higher and vary among lineages,BIONJ clearly has better topological accuracy. In the latter case, for the model trees and the conditions of evolution tested, the topological error reduction is on the average around 20\%. With highly-varying-rate trees and with high substitution rates (maximum pairwise divergence approximately 1.0 substitutions per site), the error reduction may even rise above 50\%, while the probability of finding the correct tree may be augmented by as much as 15\%.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The abrogation of function of the tumor-suppressor protein p53 as a result of mutation of its gene, TP53, is one of the most common genetic alterations in cancer cells. We evaluated TP53 mutations and survival in patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck.
METHODS: A total of 560 patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck who were treated surgically with curative intent were enrolled in our prospective multicenter, 7-year study. TP53 mutations were analyzed in DNA from the tumor specimens with the use of the Affymetrix p53 chip and the Surveyor DNA endonuclease and denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. Mutations were classified into two groups, disruptive and nondisruptive, according to the degree of disturbance of protein structure predicted from the crystal structure of the p53-DNA complexes. TP53 mutational status was compared with clinical outcome.
RESULTS: TP53 mutations were found in tumors from 224 of 420 patients (53.3\%). As compared with wild-type TP53, the presence of any TP53 mutation was associated with decreased overall survival (hazard ratio for death, 1.4; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.1 to 1.8; P=0.009), with an even stronger association with disruptive mutations (hazard ratio, 1.7; 95\% CI, 1.3 to 2.4; P{\textless}0.001) and no significant association with nondisruptive mutations (hazard ratio, 1.2; 95\% CI, 0.9 to 1.7; P=0.16). In multivariate analyses a disruptive TP53 alteration, as compared with the absence of a TP53 mutation, had an independent, significant association with decreased survival (hazard ratio, 1.7; 95\% CI, 1.2 to 2.4; P=0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: Disruptive TP53 mutations in tumor DNA are associated with reduced survival after surgical treatment of squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck.},

Experimental Design: In an attempt to identify diagnostic markers for the preoperative distinction of these lesions, we chose to study by microarray analysis the eight different thyroid tumor subtypes that can present a diagnostic challenge to the clinician.
Results: Our microarray-based analysis of 94 thyroid tumors identified 75 genes that are differentially expressed between benign and malignant tumor subtypes. Of these, 33 were overexpressed and 42 were underexpressed in malignant compared with benign thyroid tumors. Statistical analysis of these genes, using nearest-neighbor classification, showed a 73\% sensitivity and 82\% specificity in predicting malignancy. Real-time reverse transcription–PCR validation for 12 of these genes was confirmatory. Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses of one of the genes, high mobility group AT-hook 2, further validated the microarray and real-time reverse transcription–PCR data.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that these 12 genes could be useful in the development of a panel of markers to differentiate benign from malignant tumors and thus serve as an important first step in solving the clinical problem associated with suspicious thyroid lesions.},

	abstract = {In this study, we combined a novel sequencing method, which can identify individual clonotypes based on their unique T cell receptor (TCR) rearrangement, with existing immune assays to characterize antigen-specific T cell responses. We validated this approach using three types of assays routinely used to measure antigen-specific responses: pentamers which enable identification of T cells bearing specific TCRs, activation marker expression following antigen stimulation and antigen-induced proliferation to identify cytomegalovirus (CMV) specific clonotypes. In one individual, 8 clonotypes were identified using a pentamer reagent derived from the CMV pp65 protein. The same 8 clonotypes were also identified following sequencing of cells that upregulated an activation marker following incubation with an identical peptide derived from pp65. These 8 and an additional 8 clonotypes were identified using a more sensitive CFSE-based proliferation assay. We found clear sequence homology among some of the clonotypes identified, and the CDR3 region in one clonotype was identical to a previously published pp65-specific clonotype sequence. Many of these CMV-specific clonotypes were present at frequencies below 10(-5) which are undetectable using standard flow-cytometric methods. These studies suggest that an immune response is comprised of a diverse set of clones, many of which are present at very low frequencies. Thus, the combination of immune assays and sequencing depicts the richness and diversity of an immune response at a level that is not possible using standard immune assays alone. The methods articulated in this work provide an enhanced understanding of T cell-mediated immune responses at the clonal level.},

	abstract = {Antipsychotic drugs that bind to and inhibit the action of calmodulin also inhibit cellular proliferation. In addition these drugs are cytotoxic to most malignant cells and can augment the antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects of bleomycin. They are attractive candidates for use against tumors of the central nervous system since they readily pass the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in the brain. To identify more active derivatives, we studied the effect of a series of phenothiazines and a group of related compounds alone or in combination with bleomycin against rat glioblastoma cell lines. C6 cells were grown for 24 hours prior to a 48 hour exposure to anti-psychotic drug alone or to an IC20 concentration of antipsychotic drug with bleomycin. Cells were stained with methylene blue and enumerated spectrophotometrically. Eight phenothiazines were found to augment the effect of bleomycin by {\textgreater} or = 3-fold. These included 1-chlorpromazine (3.8x), chlorpromazine (3.2x), 3-chlorpromazine (3.0x), 4-chlorpromazine (3.4x), thiomethylpromazine (3.3x), didesmethylchlorpromazine (11x), fluphenazine (5.5x) and trifluoperazine (3.2x). Structurally similar compounds also having activity included trans-flupenthixol (6.0x), 2-chloroimipramine (6.0x), desipramine (22x), and penfluridol (24x). There was a direct correlation between the antiproliferative effect of anticalmodulin compounds and the ability of these drugs to inhibit the activation of calmodulin-sensitive phosphodiesterase. However, there was no correlation between the inhibition of calmodulin and the augmentation of the antiproliferative activity of bleomycin. Penfluridol, one of the most active compounds, was chosen for further study. It increased the activity of bleomycin against L1210 leukemic cells by 90-fold and MCF-7 human breast cancer cells by 4-fold. The effect of penfluridol in combination with bleomycin was due to increased cytotoxicity as measured by clonogenic assay.},

	abstract = {Little is known about the types and numbers of mutations that may accumulate in normal human cells with age. Such information would require obtaining enough DNA from a single cell to accurately carry out reliable analysis despite extensive amplification; and complete genomic coverage under these circumstances is difficult. We have compared colon crypts, which are putatively clonal and contain {\textasciitilde}2000 cells each, to determine how much somatic genetic variation occurs in vivo (without ex vivo cell culturing). Using high-density SNP microarrays, we find that chromosome deletions, duplications, and gene conversions were significantly more frequent in colons from the older individuals. These changes affected lengths ranging from 73 kb to 46 Mb. Although detection requires progeny of a single mutant stem cell to reach niche dominance over neighboring stem cells, none of the deletions appear likely to confer a selective advantage. Mutations can become fixed randomly during stem cell evolution through neutral drift in normal human crypts. The fact that chromosomal changes are detected in individual crypts with increasing age suggests that either such changes accumulate with age or single stem cell dominance increases with age, and the former is more likely. This progressive genome-wide divergence of human somatic cells with age has implications for aging and disease in multicellular organisms.},

Here we hypothesized that circulating BMMSC are incorporated into tumors and protect tumor cells from therapy-induced apoptosis. Adherent cells harvested from murine bone marrow and expressing phenotypic and functional characteristics of BMMSC were tested for their anti-tumor activity against murine 4T1 mammary adenocarcinoma and LL/2 Lewis lung carcinoma cells. BMMSC but not NIH3T3 or murine skin fibroblasts stimulated the expansion of 4T1 cells in 3D co-cultures, and conditioned medium from these cells increased the viability of 4T1 and LL/2 cells in 2D cultures. 4T1 cells exposed to BMMSC conditioned medium exhibited a 2-fold reduction in apoptosis under low serum concentrations (0.5 to 1\%). Furthermore, exposure of 4T1 and LL/2 cells to BMMSC conditioned medium increased their viability in the presence of paclitaxel or doxorubicin at therapeutic concentrations. This effect was accompanied by reductions in caspase-3 activity and Annexin V expression. When co-injected with 4T1 cells in the mammary fat pad of mice subsequently treated with doxorubicin, BMMSC (and not fibroblasts) also inhibited drug-induced apoptosis in tumor cells by 44 percent. We demonstrated that BMMSC were attracted by 4T1 and LL/2 cells but not by NIH3T3 cells in vitro and that when injected intravenously in 4T1 tumor bearing mice, these cells (and not NIH 3T3) were specifically detected in tumors within 12 to 18 days where they preferentially localized at the invasive front. Overall, our data identify BMMSC as an important mediator of tumor cell survival and treatment resistance in primary tumors.},

	abstract = {Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive malignancy with a five-year mortality of 97–98\%, usually due to widespread metastatic disease. Previous studies indicate that this disease has a complex genomic landscape, with frequent copy number changes and point mutations, but genomic rearrangements have not been characterized in detail. Despite the clinical importance of metastasis, there remain fundamental questions about the clonal structures of metastatic tumours, including phylogenetic relationships among metastases, the scale of ongoing parallel evolution in metastatic and primary sites, and how the tumour disseminates. Here we harness advances in DNA sequencing to annotate genomic rearrangements in 13 patients with pancreatic cancer and explore clonal relationships among metastases. We find that pancreatic cancer acquires rearrangements indicative of telomere dysfunction and abnormal cell-cycle control, namely dysregulated G1-to-S-phase transition with intact G2–M checkpoint. These initiate amplification of cancer genes and occur predominantly in early cancer development rather than the later stages of the disease. Genomic instability frequently persists after cancer dissemination, resulting in ongoing, parallel and even convergent evolution among different metastases. We find evidence that there is genetic heterogeneity among metastasis-initiating cells, that seeding metastasis may require driver mutations beyond those required for primary tumours, and that phylogenetic trees across metastases show organ-specific branches. These data attest to the richness of genetic variation in cancer, brought about by the tandem forces of genomic instability and evolutionary selection.},

This adverse drug reaction could be due to multiple factors such as disease determinants, environmental and genetic factors. In order to improve the efficacy and safety and to understand the disposition and clinical consequences of drugs, two rapidly developing fields – pharmacogenetics (focus is on single genes) and pharmacogenomics (focus is on many genes) – have undertaken studies on the genetic personalization of drug response. This is because many drug responses appear to be genetically determined and the relationship between genotype and drug response may have a very valuable diagnostic value. Identification and characterization of a large number of genetic polymorphisms (biomarkers) in drug metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters in an ethnically diverse group of individuals may provide substantial knowledge about the mechanisms of inter-individual differences in drug response. However, progress in understanding complex diseases, its negative psychosocial consequences, violation of privacy or discrimination, associated cost and availability and its complexity (extensive geographic variations in genes) may become potential barriers in incorporating this pharmacogenetic data in risk assessment and treatment decisions. In addition, it requires increased enthusiasm and education in the clinical community and an understanding of pharmacogenetics itself by the lay public. Although individualized medications remain as a challenge for the future, the pharmacogenetic approach in drug development should be still continued. If it becomes a reality, it delivers benefits to improve public health and allow genetically subgroup diseases thereby avoiding adverse drug reactions (by knowing in advance who should be treated with what drug and how).},

Two cases originally diagnosed as medulloblastoma were reclassified as AT/RT based on histological re-examination including immunohistochemical studies. While these two cases of AT/RT were found during infancy, only one medulloblastoma was found in infancy.Histologically, small rhabdoid cells and large, pale, bland cells were common but typical rhabdoid cells were not seen in the two AT/RTs. Gland-like structures were also seen. The tumor cells in AT/RT, but not those in medulloblastoma, were immunoreactive for vimentin, epithelial membrane antigen and smooth muscle actin. In conclusion, if a diagnosis of medulloblastoma is made histologically, it should be confirmed immunohistologically, since it is difficult to distinguish AT/RT from medulloblastoma.

Here we present an amplification-free method of library preparation, in which the cluster amplification step, rather than the polymerase chain reaction, enriches for fully ligated template strands, reducing the incidence of duplicate sequences, improving read mapping and SNP calling and aiding de novo assembly.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) contributes to multiple pathologies, including diabetes, arthritis, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer. Despite the obvious need, no RAGE inhibitors are in common clinical use. Therefore, we developed a novel small RAGE antagonist peptide (RAP) that blocks activation by multiple ligands.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: RAGE and its ligands were visualized by immunohistochemical analysis of human pancreatic tissues, and siRNA was used to analyze their functions. Interactions between RAGE and S100P, S100A4, and HMGB-1 were measured by ELISA. Three S100P-derived small antagonistic peptides were designed, synthesized, and tested for inhibition of RAGE binding. The effects of the peptide blockers on NFκB-luciferase reporter activity was used to assess effects on RAGE-mediated signaling. The most effective peptide was tested on glioma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) models.
RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the expression of RAGE and its ligands S100P, S100A4, and HMGB-1 in human PDAC. siRNA silencing of RAGE or its ligands reduced the growth and migration of PDAC cells in vitro. The most effective RAP inhibited the interaction of S100P, S100A4, and HMGB-1 with RAGE at micromolar concentrations. RAP also reduced the ability of the ligands to stimulate RAGE activation of NFκB in cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, systemic in vivo administration of RAP reduced the growth and metastasis of pancreatic tumors and also inhibited glioma tumor growth.
CONCLUSION: RAP shows promise as a tool for the investigation of RAGE function and as an in vivo treatment for RAGE-related disorders.},

Formation of rosettes with infiltrating natural killer cells, neutrophils, and macrophages was required for the subsequent destruction of cancer cells through rapid cytolysis. Highly purified natural killer cells, macrophages, and neutrophils from the SR/CR mice independently killed cancer cells in vitro. The independent killing activity by each subset of effector cells is consistent with the observation that the resistance was abolished by depleting total infiltrating leukocytes but not by depleting only one or two subsets of leukocytes. The resistance was completely transferable to WT recipient mice through SR/CR splenocytes, bone marrow cells, or enriched peritoneal macrophages, either for prevention against subsequent cancer challenges or eradication of established malignancy at distant sites.},

Our previous studies have indicated that cyclin D1 is a key downstream target of INI1/hSNF5 and genesis and/or survival of RTs in vivo is critically dependent on the presence of cyclin D1. In this report, we have tested the hypothesis that therapeutic targeting of cyclin D1 is an effective means of treating RTs. We found that RNA interference of cyclin D1 in rhabdoid cells was sufficient to induce G1 arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that pharmacological intervention with low micromolar concentrations of N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (4-HPR), which downmodulates cyclin D1, induced G1 arrest and apoptosis in rhabdoid cell lines. 4-HPR in combination with 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4OH-Tam), synergistically inhibited survival as well as anchorage-dependent and -independent growth of rhabdoid cells and caused synergistic induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. 4-HPR and tamoxifen exhibited synergistic growth inhibition of RTs in xenograft models in vivo. The effects of combination of drugs were correlated to the depletion of cyclin D1 levels both in in vitro and in vivo tumor models. These results demonstrate that 4-HPR and tamoxifen are effective chemotherapeutic agents for RTs. We propose that downmodulation of cyclin D1 is a novel and effective therapeutic strategy for RTs.},

How loss of hSNF5 contributes to tumorigenesis remains unknown. Because the SWI/SNF subunit BRG1 is required for RB-mediated cell cycle arrest, we hypothesized that hSNF5 deficiency disrupts RB signaling. Here we demonstrate that unlike BRG1, hSNF5 deficient cells retain functional RB since ectopic expression of either p16ink4a or a constitutively active form of RB (PSM-RB) led to cell cycle arrest. To determine how hSNF5 loss might contribute to tumorigenesis, we used a retrovirus to introduce hSNF5 into multiple deficient cell lines. In all cases, re-expression inhibited colony formation and induced cell cycle arrest characterized by a flattened morphology. Flow cytometry revealed that these cells accumulated in G0/G1. Importantly, arrested cells exhibited strong induction of p16ink4a, hypophosphorylated RB, and down-regulation of cyclin A, suggesting that hSNF5 signals upstream of RB to induce growth arrest. Co-expression of SV40 T/t abolished hSNF5-induced G1 arrest and activation of RB. Likewise, HPV-16 E7 was sufficient to partially overcome cell cycle arrest. These results suggest that hSNF5 loss is not equivalent to BRG1/BRM loss in human tumor cell lines. Furthermore, hSNF5-induced cell cycle arrest of deficient cells is mediated in part through activation of p16ink4a expression. These findings provide insight into mechanisms of hSNF5-mediated tumor suppression.},

The most potent compounds were calmidazolium and melittin as compared to the phenothiazines, trifluoperazine, chlorpromazine, chlorpromazine-sulfoxide or the diphenylbutylpiperidine, pimozide. The mechanism by which the inhibition of calmodulin leads to the death of cells could not be attributed entirely to inhibition of the calmodulin-sensitive cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase. Calmodulin is a heat stable, calcium-binding protein involved in numerous biological processes. Recent evidence indicates that calcium and calmodulin may be important for cellular proliferation. For example, this protein changes in concentration during the cell cycle; is involved in the disassembly of the mitotic apparatus; is increased in concentration in rapidly growing hepatomas and in transformed fibroblasts. Weiss and co-workers demonstrated that phenothiazines and structurally similar drugs are capable of binding to and inhibiting the activity of calmodulin. It has been recently observed that certain drugs that inhibit the activity of calmodulin also inhibit the growth of malignant cells in vitro and in vivo. In these studies, however, there was no direct correlation of the effect of the drugs on the calmodulin from the cell type under investigation with cytotoxicity. To learn more about the relationship between a drug's ability to inhibit calmodulin and its antiproliferative activity, we correlated the effect of drugs on the activity of calmodulin prepared from the C6 astrocytoma cell line with their effect on cellular proliferation. Since many inhibitors of calmodulin readily cross the blood-brain barrier and since no acceptable treatment for malignancies of the central nervous system exist, we chose this cell line as a model for elucidating the potential antineoplastic effects of calmodulin inhibitors.},

	abstract = {In the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM) the impact of radical tumor resection as first line therapy is beyond controversy. The significance of a second resection in case of tumor-recurrence remains unclear and is an issue of debate. Since GBMs always recur, it is important to determine whether or not patients will benefit from repeat surgery. We performed a retrospective analysis of our prospectively collected database and evaluated all re-resected patients with primary GBM who underwent second surgery during a 3 years period. All patients underwent early postoperative magnetic resonance imaging. We determined survival after re-resection with regard to possible prognostic factors using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox regression analyses. Forty patients were included in this study. Median age was 58 years and median KPS score was 80. Average tumor volume was 5.5 cm(3). A radiologically confirmed complete resection was achieved in 29 patients (72.5 \%). Median follow-up was 18.8 months, and median survival after re-resection was 13.5 months. Only complete removal of contrast enhancing tumor was significantly correlated with survival after re-resection according to multivariate analysis. There was a statistical trend for KPS score influencing survival. In contrast, time between first diagnosis and tumor-recurrence, tumor volume at recurrence, MGMT status and MSM score were not significantly correlated with survival after second surgery. In the event of tumor recurrence, patients in good clinical condition with recurrent GBM amenable to complete resection should thus not be withheld second surgery as a treatment option.},

	volume = {104},
	issn = {0008-543X},
	doi = {10.1002/cncr.21288},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Approximately 5\% of clear cell renal cell carcinomas contain components with sarcomatoid differentiation. It has been suggested that the sarcomatoid elements arise from the clear cell tumors as a consequence of clonal expansions of neoplastic cells with progressively more genetic alterations. Analysis of the pattern of allelic loss and X-chromosome inactivation in both the clear cell and sarcomatoid components of the same tumor allows assessment of the genetic relationship of these tumor elements.
METHODS: The authors of the current study examined the pattern of allelic loss in clear cell and sarcomatoid components of renal cell carcinomas from 22 patients who had tumors with both components. DNA samples were prepared from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded renal tissue sections using laser-capture microdissection. Five microsatellite polymorphic markers for putative tumor suppressor genes on 5 different chromosomes were analyzed. These included D3S1300 (3p14), D7S522 (7q31), D8S261 (8p21), D9S171 (9p21), and TP53 (17p13). In addition, X-chromosome inactivation analysis was performed in 14 tumors from female patients.
RESULTS: The clear cell components showed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the D3S1300, D7S522, D8S261, D9S171, and TP53 loci in 18\% (4/22), 18\% (4/22), 50\% (10/20), 15\% (3/20), and 20\% (4/20) of informative cases, respectively. LOH in the sarcomatoid components was seen at the D3S1300, D7S522, D8S261, D9S171, and TP53 loci in 18\% (4/22), 41\% (9/22), 70\% (14/20), 35\% (7/20), and 20\% (4/20) of informative cases, respectively. Six cases demonstrated an LOH pattern in the clear cell component that was not seen in the sarcomatoid component. Different patterns of allelic loss were seen in the clear cell and sarcomatoid components in 15 cases. Clonality analysis showed the same pattern of nonrandom X-chromosome inactivation in both clear cell and sarcomatoid components in 13 of the 14 cases studied. One case showed a random pattern of X-chromosome inactivation.
CONCLUSION: X-chromosome inactivation analysis data suggest that both clear cell and sarcomatoid components of renal cell carcinomas are derived from the same progenitor cell. Different patterns of allelic loss in multiple chromosomal regions were observed in clear cell and sarcomatoid components from the same patient. This genetic heterogeneity indicates genetic divergence during the clonal evolution of renal cell carcinoma.},

Different approaches for measuring synchronization have been proposed that rely on certain characteristic features of the dynamical system under investigation. For experimental data the underlying dynamics are usually not completely known, therefore it is difficult to decide a priori which synchronization measure is most suitable for an analysis. In this study we use three different coupled model systems to create a ‘controlled’ setting for a comparison of six different measures of synchronization. All measures are compared to each other with respect to their ability to distinguish between different levels of coupling and their robustness against noise. Results show that the measure to be applied to a certain task can not be chosen according to a fixed criterion but rather pragmatically as the measure which most reliably yields plausible information in test applications, although certain dynamical features of a system under investigation (e.g., power spectra, dimension) may render certain measures more suitable than others.},

We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of risk-adapted radiotherapy followed by a shortened period of dose-intense chemotherapy in children with medulloblastoma.
METHODS: After resection, patients were classified as having average-risk medulloblastoma ({\textless} or = 1.5 cm2 residual tumour and no metastatic disease) or high-risk medulloblastoma ({\textgreater} 1.5 cm2 residual disease or metastatic disease localised to neuraxis) medulloblastoma. All patients received risk-adapted craniospinal radiotherapy (23.4 Gy for average-risk disease and 36.0-39.6 Gy for high-risk disease) followed by four cycles of cyclophosphamide-based, dose-intensive chemotherapy. Patients were assessed regularly for disease status and treatment side-effects. The primary endpoint was 5-year event-free survival; we also measured overall survival. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00003211.
FINDINGS: Of 134 children with medulloblastoma who underwent treatment (86 average-risk, 48 high-risk), 119 (89\%) completed the planned protocol. No treatment-related deaths occurred. 5-year overall survival was 85\% (95\% CI 75-94) in patients in the average-risk group and 70\% (54-84) in those in the high-risk group (p=0.04); 5-year event-free survival was 83\% (73-93) and 70\% (55-85), respectively (p=0.046). For the 116 patients whose histology was reviewed centrally, histological subtype correlated with 5-year event-free survival (p=0.04): 84\% (74-95) for classic histology, 77\% (49-100) for desmoplastic tumours, and 57\% (33-80) for large-cell anaplastic tumours.
INTERPRETATION: Risk-adapted radiotherapy followed by a shortened schedule of dose-intensive chemotherapy can be used to improve the outcome of patients with high-risk medulloblastoma.},

Although mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)-deletion mutations have been shown to accumulate with age, for these aberrant genomes to be physiologically relevant, they must accumulate to high levels intracellularly and be present in a significant number of cells. We examined mtDNA-deletion mutations in vastus lateralis (VL) muscle of human subjects aged 49-93 years, using both histologic and polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) analyses, to determine the physiological and genomic integrity of mitochondria in aging human muscle. The number of VL muscle fibers exhibiting mitochondrial electron-transport-system (ETS) abnormalities increased from an estimated 6\% at age 49 years to 31\% at age 92 years. We analyzed the mitochondrial genotype of 48 single ETS-abnormal, cytochrome c oxidase-negative/succinate dehydrogenase-hyperreactive (COX-/SDH++) fibers from normal aging human subjects and identified mtDNA-deletion mutations in all abnormal fibers. Deletion mutations were clonal within a fiber and concomitant to the COX-/SDH++ region. Quantitative PCR analysis of wild-type and deletion-containing mtDNA genomes within ETS-abnormal regions of single fibers demonstrated that these deletion mutations accumulate to detrimental levels ({\textgreater}90\% of the total mtDNA).},

However, given the large number of genetic anomalies present in most cancers, it has been difficult to evaluate the extent to which epigenetic changes contribute to cancer. SNF5 (INI1/SMARCB1/BAF47) is a tumor suppressor that regulates the epigenome as a core member of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. While the SWI/SNF complex displays potent tumor suppressor activity, it is unknown whether this activity is exerted genetically via maintenance of genome integrity or epigenetically via transcriptional regulation. Here we show that Snf5-deficient primary cells do not show altered sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, defects in gamma-H2AX induction, or an abrogated DNA damage checkpoint. Further, the aggressive malignancies that arise following SNF5 loss are diploid and genomically stable. Remarkably, we demonstrate that most human SNF5-deficient cancers lack genomic amplifications/deletions and, aside from SNF5 loss, are indistinguishable from normal cells on single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays. Finally, we show that epigenetically based changes in transcription that occur following SNF5 loss correlate with the tumor phenotype. Collectively, our results provide novel insight into the mechanisms of oncogenesis by demonstrating that disruption of a chromatin remodeling complex can largely, if not completely, substitute for genomic instability in the genesis of aggressive cancer.},

	abstract = {INI1/hSNF5 is a component of the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling hSWI/SNF complex and a tumor suppressor gene of aggressive pediatric atypical teratoid and malignant rhabdoid tumors (AT/RT). To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying its tumor suppressor function, we studied the effect of reintroduction of INI1/hSNF5 into AT/RT-derived cell lines such as MON that carry biallelic deletions of the INI1/hSNF5 locus. We demonstrate that expression of INI1/hSNF5 causes G(0)-G(1) arrest and flat cell formation in these cells. In addition, INI1/hSNF5 repressed transcription of cyclin D1 gene in MON, in a histone deacetylase (HDAC)-dependent manner. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies revealed that INI1/hSNF5 was directly recruited to the cyclin D1 promoter and that its binding correlated with recruitment of HDAC1 and deacetylation of histones at the promoter. Analysis of INI1/hSNF5 truncations indicated that cyclin D1 repression and flat cell formation are tightly correlated. Coexpression of cyclin D1 from a heterologous promoter in MON was sufficient to eliminate the INI1-mediated flat cell formation and cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, cyclin D1 was overexpressed in AT/RT tumors. Our data suggest that one of the mechanisms by which INI1/hSNF5 exerts its tumor suppressor function is by mediating the cell cycle arrest due to the direct recruitment of HDAC activity to the cyclin D1 promoter thereby causing its repression and G(0)-G(1) arrest. Repression of cyclin D1 gene expression may serve as a useful strategy to treat AT/RT.},

No clinical factor differed significantly between the groups of patients with regional or marginal tumor progression (N = 22) and patients with distant or multiple recurrences (N = 8). Progression-free survival did not differ significantly between these two groups (p = 0.27). However, overall survival was significantly longer (p = 0.04) in patients with regional or marginal tumor progression, and constituted 90\% and 54\% at 1 and 2 years after surgery, respectively, compared to 75\% and 0\% in patients with distant or multiple recurrences. Aggressive surgical resection and adjuvant management of intracranial glioblastoma may change its recurrence pattern. Tumor progression appears in the wall of the resection cavity or within 2 cm from its margin in approximately half of patients.},

	abstract = {Glioblastoma is the most frequent and most malignant human brain tumor. The prognosis remains very poor, with most patients dying within 1 year after diagnosis. Primary and secondary glioblastoma constitute distinct disease subtypes, affecting patients of different age and developing through different genetic pathways. The majority of cases ({\textgreater}90\%) are primary glioblastomas that develop rapidly de novo, without clinical or histological evidence of a less malignant precursor lesion. They affect mainly the elderly and are genetically characterized by loss of heterozygosity 10q (70\% of cases), EGFR amplification (36\%), p16(INK4a) deletion (31\%), and PTEN mutations (25\%). Secondary glioblastomas develop through progression from low-grade diffuse astrocytoma or anaplastic astrocytoma and manifest in younger patients. In the pathway to secondary glioblastoma, TP53 mutations are the most frequent and earliest detectable genetic alteration, already present in 60\% of precursor low-grade astrocytomas. The mutation pattern is characterized by frequent G:C--{\textgreater}A:T mutations at CpG sites. During progression to glioblastoma, additional mutations accumulate, including loss of heterozygosity 10q25-qter ( approximately 70\%), which is the most frequent genetic alteration in both primary and secondary glioblastomas. Primary and secondary glioblastomas also differ significantly in their pattern of promoter methylation and in expression profiles at RNA and protein levels. This has significant implications, particularly for the development of novel, targeted therapies, as discussed in this review.},

Additionally, cytoreductive nephrectomy is often indicated before the start of systemic treatment in patients with metastatic disease as part of integrated management strategy. The effectiveness of immunotherapy, although previously widely used for treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, is still controversial, and is mainly reserved for patients with good prognostic factors. Development of treatments that have specific targets in relevant biological pathways has been the main advance in treatment. Targeted drugs, including inhibitors of the vascular endothelial growth factor and mammalian target of rapamycin pathways, have shown robust effectiveness and offer new therapeutic options for the patients with metastatic disease.},

	abstract = {Overexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) has been implicated as the mechanism of multidrug resistance (MDR) in a number of human cancers, including carcinoma of the breast. We conducted a clinical trial to determine whether the P-gp inhibitor, trifluoperazine, could sensitize patients with refractory breast cancer to vinblastine chemotherapy. Adult patients with histologically confirmed, refractory, advanced breast cancer were treated with vinblastine at a dose of 1.7 mg/m2 per day by continuous infusion for five consecutive days. Patients who did not respond after two cycles were subsequently treated with vinblastine plus trifluoperazine at a dose of 8 mg twice daily during the five days of chemotherapy. In patients from whom tumor samples were available, the expression of P-gp was determined by immunocytochemistry. Of 35 patients enrolled, 30 were evaluable, 2 of whom (7\%) achieved a partial response to vinblastine alone. Among the 16 patients treated with vinblastine plus trifluoperazine there was one response (6\%) which lasted 16 weeks. Tumor samples were available from 16 patients, and 14 (87\%) were immunoreactive for P-pg. P\_pg expression was detected both in the patient who responded to vinblastine plus trifluoperazine and in one of the two patients who responded to vinblastine alone. Continuous-infusion vinblastine demonstrated limited activity in this study. Furthermore, trifluoperazine did not effectively reverse established resistance to vinblastine. This failure may be related the presence of multiple mechanisms of drug resistance in the heavily pretreated population, or because ineffective concentrations of the modulator were achieved in vivo. Future studies should evaluate more effective modulators, and attempt to reverse MDR earlier in the course of treatment, before other forms of resistance can develop.},

This model measures the rate at which an individual's methylome ages, which we show is impacted by gender and genetic variants. We also show that differences in aging rates help explain epigenetic drift and are reflected in the transcriptome. Moreover, we show how our aging model is upheld in other human tissues and reveals an advanced aging rate in tumor tissue.

	abstract = {In solid tumours, necrosis is commonly found in the core region in response to metabolic stress that results from oxygen and glucose depletion (OGD) due to insufficient vascularization and has been implicated in tumour progression. We have previously shown that metabolic stress due to glucose depletion (GD) induces necrosis and HMGB1 release through mitochondrial ROS production in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells. In this study, we examined the effects of hypoxia on GD-induced necrosis and show that hypoxia prevented GD-induced mitochondrial ROS production, HMGB1 release, and necrosis and switched the cell death mode to apoptosis that is dependent on caspase-3 and -9. We further found that inhibition of ERK1/2 by U0126 abolished the effects of hypoxia to switch the cell death mode and to suppress mitochondrial ROS production, indicating an important role(s) of the ERK pathway in cell death mode determination. We also found that during OGD-induced apoptosis the prosurvival protein kinase Akt is activated and inhibition of Akt by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin prevent OGD-induced apoptosis, caspase-3 and -9 activation, and nuclear translocation of AIF and EndoG. Similar inhibitory effects of PI3K inhibitors were observed in A549 cells that underwent apoptosis when treated with GD in the presence of NAC (a general antioxidant) or catalase (a H(2)O(2) scavenger), or in the presence of active PKC by treatment with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, indicating a crucial role(s) of the PI3K-Akt pathway in OGD-indcued apoptosis. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that hypoxia switches GD-induced necrosis to apoptosis and ERK1/2 and PI3K-Akt exert anti-necrotic and pro-apoptotic activities in the cell death, respectively.},

	abstract = {To identify chemoresistance-related genes of gastric cancer, we utilized cDNA microarray technology. Thirty-five gastric cancer specimens surgically resected at our institute between 1998 and 1999 were studied for quantification of expression of 6300 genes by means of oligonucleotide microarray methods, and the results were evaluated in comparison with the chemoresistance of the specimens, which was determined by MTT (tetrazolium-based 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Inhibition rates (IR) were determined for cisplatin (DDP), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), mitomycin C or doxorubicin. IR of 60\% or more was regarded as sensitive to each agent, and IR of less than 40\% was defined as resistant. Clustering was successfully completed for DDP, resulting in selection of 23 candidates as DDP-resistance-related genes, including vascular permeability factor, 2 membrane transporting subunits, and retinoblastoma-binding protein-1. In addition, further selection of DDP-resistance-related genes was performed according to these criteria: 1) Expression of the gene can be detected in more than 70\% of resistant tumors. 2) Expression can be detected in less than 30\% of sensitive tumors. 3) Expression in tumors is more than twice that of normal mucosa in more than 50\% of specimens. Then, metallothionein-IG and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) were identified as candidate DDP-resistance-related genes. When known DDP-resistance-related genes were analyzed according to the MTT assay result, families of glutathione-S-transferase and cyclooxygenase-2 genes were also evaluated as resistance-related genes. For 5-FU resistance, dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase and HB-EGF-like growth factor genes were also suggested to be resistance-related genes. The present study demonstrated that oligonucleotide microarrays can provide information regarding chemoresistance factors in cancer.},

	abstract = {Purpose To describe clinical features, therapeutic approaches, and prognostic factors in pediatric patients with atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (ATRT) treated at St Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH).
Patients and Methods Primary tumor samples from patients diagnosed with ATRT at SJCRH between July 1984 and June 2003 were identified. Pathology review included histologic, immunohistochemical analysis, and fluorescence in situ hybridization for SMARCB1 (also known as hSNF5/INI1) deletion. Clinical records of patients with pathologic confirmation of ATRT were reviewed.
Results Thirty-seven patients were diagnosed with ATRT at SJCRH during the 19-year study interval. Six patients were excluded from this clinical review based on pathologic or clinical criteria. Of the remaining 31 patients, 22 were younger than 3 years. Posterior fossa primary lesions and metastatic disease at diagnosis were more common in younger patients with ATRT. All patients underwent surgical resection; 30 received subsequent chemotherapy. The majority of patients aged 3 years or older received postoperative craniospinal radiation. Two-year event-free (EFS) and overall survival (OS) of children aged 3 years or older (EFS, 78\% + 14\%; OS, 89\% ± 11\%) were significantly better than those for younger patients (EFS, 11\% ± 6\%; OS, 17\% ± 8\%); EFS, P = .009 and OS, P = .0001. No other clinical characteristics were predictive of survival. Three of four patients 3 years or older with progressive disease were successfully rescued with ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide therapy.
Conclusion Children presenting with ATRT before the age of 3 years have a dismal prognosis. ATRT presenting in older patients can be cured using a combination of radiation and high-dose alkylating therapy. Older patients with relapsed ATRT can have salvage treatment using ICE chemotherapy.},

	abstract = {IL-5 is involved in a number of immune responses such as helminth infection and allergy. IL-5 also plays roles in innate immunity by maintaining B-1 B cells and mucosal IgA production. However, the identity of IL-5-producing cells has not been unambiguously characterized. In this report, we describe the generation of an IL-5 reporter mouse and identify IL-5-producing non-T lymphoid cells that reside in the intestine, peritoneal cavity, and lungs in naive mice. They share many characteristics with natural helper cells, nuocytes, and Ih2 cells, including surface Ags and responsiveness to cytokines. However, these phenotypes do not completely overlap with any particular one of these cell types. Innate non-T IL-5-producing cells localized most abundantly in the lung and proliferated and upregulated IL-5 production in response to IL-25 and IL-33. IL-33 was more effective than IL-25. These cells contribute to maintaining sufficient numbers of lung eosinophils and are important for eosinophil recruitment mediated by IL-25 and IL-33. Given that eosinophils are shown to possess antitumor activity, we studied lung tumor metastasis and showed that innate IL-5-producing cells were increased in response to tumor invasion, and their regulation of eosinophils is critical to suppress tumor metastasis. Genetic blockade or neutralization of IL-5 impaired eosinophil recruitment into the lung and resulted in increased tumor metastasis. Conversely, exogenous IL-5 treatment resulted in suppressed tumor metastasis and augmented eosinophil infiltration. These newly identified innate IL-5-producing cells thus play a role in tumor surveillance through lung eosinophils and may contribute to development of novel immunotherapies for cancer.},

	doi = {10.1200/JCO.2005.04.4974},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: Traditional genetic approaches to identify gene mutations in cancer are expensive and laborious. Nonetheless, if we are to avoid rejecting effective molecular targeted therapies, we must test these drugs in patients whose tumors harbor mutations in the drug target. We hypothesized that gene expression profiling might be a more rapid and cost-effective method of identifying tumors that contain specific genetic abnormalities.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Gene expression profiles of 46 samples of medulloblastoma were generated using the U133av2 Affymetrix oligonucleotide array and validated using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. Genetic abnormalities were confirmed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and direct sequencing.
RESULTS: Unsupervised analysis of gene expression profiles partitioned medulloblastomas into five distinct subgroups (subgroups A to E). Gene expression signatures that distinguished these subgroups predicted the presence of key molecular alterations that we subsequently confirmed by gene sequence analysis and FISH. Subgroup-specific abnormalities included mutations in the Wingless (WNT) pathway and deletion of chromosome 6 (subgroup B) and mutations in the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) pathway (subgroup D). Real-time RT-PCR analysis of gene expression profiles was then used to predict accurately the presence of mutations in the WNT and SHH pathways in a separate group of 31 medulloblastomas.
CONCLUSION: Genome-wide expression profiles can partition large tumor cohorts into subgroups that are enriched for specific genetic alterations. This approach may assist ultimately in the selection of patients for future clinical trials of molecular targeted therapies.},

	abstract = {Stable silencing of the INK4b-ARF-INK4a tumor suppressor locus occurs in a variety of human cancers, including malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRTs). MRTs are extremely aggressive cancers caused by the loss of the hSNF5 subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex. We found previously that, in MRT cells, hSNF5 is required for p16(INK4a) induction, mitotic checkpoint activation, and cellular senescence. Here, we investigated how the balance between Polycomb group (PcG) silencing and SWI/SNF activation affects epigenetic control of the INK4b-ARF-INK4a locus in MRT cells. hSNF5 reexpression in MRT cells caused SWI/SNF recruitment and activation of p15(INK4b) and p16(INK4a), but not of p14(ARF). Gene activation by hSNF5 is strictly dependent on the SWI/SNF motor subunit BRG1. SWI/SNF mediates eviction of the PRC1 and PRC2 PcG silencers and extensive chromatin reprogramming. Concomitant with PcG complex removal, the mixed lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) protein is recruited and active histone marks supplant repressive ones. Strikingly, loss of PcG complexes is accompanied by DNA methyltransferase DNMT3B dissociation and reduced DNA methylation. Thus, various chromatin states can be modulated by SWI/SNF action. Collectively, these findings emphasize the close interconnectivity and dynamics of diverse chromatin modifications in cancer and gene control.},

This method is extremely specific, eliminating false positives in the absence of mutant molecules, and highly sensitive, being capable of detecting mutations at the level of 0.1\% of total molecules. Moreover, the reaction can be multiplexed to identify more than one mutation per reaction. Using this technique, the levels of three point mutations, the tRNA(Leu(UUA)) 3243 mutation causing mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS); the tRNA(Lys) 8344 mutation causing myoclonic epilepsy and ragged red fibers (MERRF); and the nucleotide position 414 mutation adjacent to the control region promoters, were evaluated in human brain and muscle from individuals of various ages. While none of the mutations were detected in brain samples from individuals ranging in age from 23 to 93, the 414 mutation could be detected in muscle from individuals 30 years and older. These data demonstrate that the 3243 and 8344 mutations do not accumulate with age to levels greater than 0.1\% in brain and muscle. By contrast, the 414 mutation accumulates with age in normal human muscle, though not in brain. The reason for the striking absence of the 414 mutation in aging brain is unknown.},

A strong promoter was inserted approximately randomly into the genomes of tumor-derived breast cancer cells, using a novel lentiviral vector. We isolated a docetaxel-resistant clone in which the level of the kinesin KIFC3 was elevated. When KIFC3 or the additional kinesins KIFC1, KIF1A, or KIF5A were overexpressed in the breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB231 and MDA-MB 468, the cells became more resistant to docetaxel. The binding of kinesins to microtubules opposes the stabilizing effect of docetaxel that prevents cytokinesis and leads to apoptosis. Our finding that kinesins can mediate docetaxel resistance might lead to novel therapeutic approaches in which kinesin inhibitors are paired with taxanes.},

Notably, amplification of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) within a single tumor specimen obtained from patients is frequently observed. In this study, use of a detailed multicolor FISH mapping procedure in pathologic specimens revealed a mutual exclusivity of gene amplification in the majority of glioblastoma tumors examined. In particular, the two most commonly amplified RTK genes, EGFR and PDGFRA, were found to be present in variable proportions across the tumors, with one or the other gene predominating in certain areas of the same specimen. Our findings have profound implications for designing efficacious therapeutic regimens, as it remains unclear that how the cells with different gene amplification events contribute to disease propagation or the response to molecular targeted therapies.},

These events inhibited cancer cell proliferation and subsequently enhanced MCF-7 breast cancer cell apoptosis. Bcl-2 knockdown using small interfering RNA (siRNA) delayed apoptotic cell death, which correlated with increased proliferation following aspirin exposure. In contrast, Bcl-2 overexpression enhanced the onset of aspirin-induced apoptosis, which was also associated with a significant increase in Bcl-2 phosphorylation in the nucleus. Therefore, this study may provide novel insight into the molecular mechanism of aspirin, particularly its anticancer effects in Bcl-2- and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells.},

The prospect of targeted therapies and the development of high-resolution, genome-wide approaches are now spurring systematic efforts to characterize cancer genomes. Here we report a large-scale project to characterize copy-number alterations in primary lung adenocarcinomas. By analysis of a large collection of tumours (n = 371) using dense single nucleotide polymorphism arrays, we identify a total of 57 significantly recurrent events. We find that 26 of 39 autosomal chromosome arms show consistent large-scale copy-number gain or loss, of which only a handful have been linked to a specific gene. We also identify 31 recurrent focal events, including 24 amplifications and 7 homozygous deletions. Only six of these focal events are currently associated with known mutations in lung carcinomas. The most common event, amplification of chromosome 14q13.3, is found in {\textasciitilde}12\% of samples. On the basis of genomic and functional analyses, we identify NKX2-1 (NK2 homeobox 1, also called TITF1), which lies in the minimal 14q13.3 amplification interval and encodes a lineage-specific transcription factor, as a novel candidate proto-oncogene involved in a significant fraction of lung adenocarcinomas. More generally, our results indicate that many of the genes that are involved in lung adenocarcinoma remain to be discovered.},

	abstract = {Rhabdoid tumors are aggressive pediatric malignancies for which, currently, there are no effective or standard treatment strategies. Rhabdoid tumors arise because of the loss of the tumor suppressor gene INI1. We have previously demonstrated that INI1 represses Cyclin D1 transcription in rhabdoid cells by directly recruiting histone deacetylase 1 complex to its promoter, leading to G(0)-G(1) arrest. Expression of Cyclin D1 overcomes cell cycle arrest mediated by INI1 and Cyclin D1 overexpression in human rhabdoid tumors is a common phenomenon. However, it is not clear whether Cyclin D1 is a critical downstream target of INI1 in vivo and whether the derepression of this gene is essential for rhabdoid tumorigenesis. To determine the requirement of Cyclin D1 for genesis of rhabdoid tumors in vivo, we developed Ini1 heterozygous mice by targeted disruption. We found that the tumors developed in these Ini1+/- mice are rhabdoid, defective for Ini1 protein, and like the human tumors, express Cyclin D1. We crossed Ini1+/- mice to Cyclin D1-/- mice and found that Ini1+/- mice with Cyclin D1 deficiency did not develop any spontaneous tumors, in contrast to the parental Ini1+/- mice. These results strongly support the hypothesis that Cyclin D1 is a key mediator in the genesis of rhabdoid tumors. Our results provide an in vivo proof of concept that drugs that target Cyclin D1 expression or activity could be potentially effective as novel therapeutic agents for rhabdoid tumors.},

Similar changes in the abundance of H2A isoforms are also associated with the proliferation and tumorigenicity of bladder cancer cells. To determine whether these H2A isoforms can perform distinct functions, expression of several H2A isoforms was reduced by siRNA knockdown. Reduced expression of the HIST1H2AC locus leads to increased rates of cell proliferation and tumorigenicity. We also observe that regulation of replication-dependent histone H2A expression can occur on a gene-specific level. Specific replication-dependent histone H2A genes are either up- or downregulated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia tumor tissue samples. In addition, discreet elements are identified in the 5' untranslated region of the HIST1H2AC locus that confer translational repression. Taken together, these results indicate that replication-dependent histone isoforms can possess distinct cellular functions and that regulation of these isoforms may play a role in carcinogenesis.},

One mutant EGFR (variously named ΔEGFR, de2-7 EGFR, or EGFRvIII), which occurs frequently in human cancers, lacks a portion of the extracellular ligand-binding domain due to genomic deletions that eliminate exons 2 to 7 and confers a dramatic enhancement of brain tumor cell tumorigenicity in vivo. In order to dissect the molecular mechanisms of this activity, we analyzed location, autophosphorylation, and attenuation of the mutant receptors. The mutant receptors were expressed on the cell surface and constitutively autophosphorylated at a significantly decreased level compared with wild-type EGFR activated by ligand treatment. Unlike wild-type EGFR, the constitutively active ΔEGFR were not down-regulated, suggesting that the altered conformation of the mutant did not result in exposure of receptor sequence motifs required for endocytosis and lysosomal sorting. Mutational analysis showed that the enhanced tumorigenicity was dependent on intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity and was mediated through the carboxyl terminus. In contrast with wild-type receptor, mutation of any major tyrosine autophosphorylation site abolished these activities suggesting that the biological functions of ΔEGFR are due to low constitutive activation with mitogenic effects amplified by failure to attenuate signaling by receptor down-regulation.},

	abstract = {2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (CdA, Cladribine) is an immunosuppressant that has recently been shown to be effective in the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). There is extensive clinical experience with CdA for the treatment of neoplastic diseases, especially hematologic malignancies, due to its apoptotic effects on leukemic and several other neoplastic cells. Furthermore, CdA crosses the blood-brain-barrier and thus may also exert its effects directly on cells of the central nervous system (CNS). Therefore, we have studied the effects of CdA on cultured primary rat microglia, the resident macrophage in the CNS, which is also thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of MS. Treatment of microglia with CdA inhibited their proliferation and induced apoptosis. Phosphorylation of CdA to CdATP was required for both effects and was inhibited by deoxycytidine. Furthermore, activation of caspase-3 and -9 revealed the involvement of the intrinsic mitochondrial mediated apoptotic pathway. However, the absence of caspase-8 activation specified independency from the extrinsic death receptor mediated apoptosis. The mitochondrial membrane potential was significantly reduced after CdA exposure and was not conserved with Bax or caspase-3 inhibition. Assessment of DNA fragmentation by TUNEL and DNA-release-assay showed microglia with fragmented nuclei. Other functions of microglia like phagocytosis and LPS-induced NO and TNF-α release were not affected by CdA. These data suggest a potential of CdA treatment to induce not only leukopenia but also apoptosis in microglia in the CNS. These results help to understand the mechanism of action of CdA in CNS diseases and may open the possibility to target microglia.},

When transplanted into a mouse wild-type excisional wound model, VEGF-overexpressing ASCs led to significantly accelerated wound healing, with full wound closure observed at 8 days compared to 10–12 days in groups treated with ASCs alone or saline control (*P {\textless} 0.05). Histology and polarized microscopy showed increased collagen deposition and more mature collagen fibers in the dermis of wound beds treated using PBAE/VEGF-modified ASCs than ASCs alone. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of using nonviral-engineered ASCs to accelerate wound healing, which may provide an alternative therapy for treating many diseases in which wound healing is impaired.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. Current treatment decisions are based on clinical variables. Novel tumor-derived biomarkers may improve the risk stratification of medulloblastoma patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A model for the molecular risk stratification was proposed from an array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) screen (n = 80). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses for chromosome arms 6q, 17p, and 17q and the MYC and MYCN loci were performed in an independent validation set (n = 260). Copy number aberrations were correlated with clinical, histologic, and survival data.
RESULTS: Gain of 6q and 17q and genomic amplification of MYC or MYCN were each associated with poor outcome in the array-CGH study (n = 80). In contrast, all patients with 6q-deleted tumors survived. Given these findings, the following hierarchical molecular staging system was defined: (1) MYC/MYCN amplification, (2) 6q gain, (3) 17q gain, (4) 6q and 17q balanced, and (5) 6q deletion. The prognostic value of this staging system was investigated by FISH analysis (n = 260). The addition of molecular markers to clinical risk factors resulted in the identification of a large proportion of patients (72 of 260 patients; 30\%) at high risk for relapse and death who would be considered standard risk by application of clinical variables alone.
CONCLUSION: Genomic aberrations in medulloblastoma are powerful independent markers of disease progression and survival. By adding genomic markers to established clinical and histologic variables, outcome prediction can be substantially improved. Because the analyses can be conducted on routine paraffin-embedded material, it will be especially feasible to use this novel molecular staging system in large multicenter clinical trials.},

However, the molecular landscape of atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RTs) remains largely unexplored. To address this issue, we used microarrays to measure the gene expression profiles of 18 AT/RTs and performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering to determine molecularly similar subgroups. Four major subgroups (clusters) were identified. These did not conform to sex, tumor location, or presence of monosomy 22. Clusters showed distinct gene signatures and differences in enriched biological processes, including elevated expression of some genes associated with choroid plexus lineage in cluster 4. In addition, survival differed significantly by cluster, with shortest survival (mean, 4.7 months) in both clusters 3 and 4, compared with clusters 1 and 2 (mean, 28.1 months). Analysis showed that multiple bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway genes were upregulated in the short survival clusters, with BMP4 showing the most significant upregulation (270-fold). Thus, high expression of BMP pathway genes was negatively associated with survival in this dataset. Our study indicates that molecular subgroups exist in AT/RTs and that molecular profiling of these comparatively rare tumors may be of diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic value.},

	abstract = {Most of major algorithms for phylogenetic tree reconstruction assume that sequences in the analyzed set either do not have any offspring, or that parent sequences can maximally mutate into just two descendants. The graph resulting from such assumptions forms therefore a binary tree, with all the nodes labeled as leaves. However, these constraints are unduly restrictive as there are numerous data sets with multiple offspring of the same ancestors. Here we propose a solution to analyze and visualize such sets in a more intuitive manner. The method reconstructs phylogenetic tree by assigning the sequences with offspring as internal nodes, and the sequences without offspring as leaf nodes. In the resulting tree there is no constraint for the number of adjacent nodes, which means that the solution tree needs not to be a binary graph only. The subsequent derivation of evolutionary pathways, and pair-wise mutations, are then an algorithmically straightforward, with edge's length corresponding directly to the number of mutations. Other tree reconstruction algorithms can be extended in the proposed manner, to also give unbiased topologies.},

	abstract = {INI1 (hSNF5/SMARCB1), a member of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex located on chromosome 22q11.2, is deleted or/or mutated in strictly defined malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRT) of infancy. Recent studies suggest that some epithelioid sarcomas (ES) also show inactivation of INI1. However, very few cases of ES have been studied, and INI1 expression in other epithelioid malignant neoplasms has not been examined systematically. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the immunohistochemical expression of INI1 in ES compared with histologic mimics. We evaluated 350 tumors: 136 ES, including 64 conventional ("distal") ES, 64 proximal-type ES, and 8 with hybrid features of conventional and proximal-type ES; 54 metastatic carcinomas (22 from lung, 6 breast, 6 stomach, 5 colorectum, 5 kidney, 5 prostate, 5 pancreas); 12 metastatic testicular embryonal carcinomas; 20 metastatic melanomas; 20 epithelioid mesotheliomas; 20 epithelioid angiosarcomas; 10 epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas; 24 epithelioid malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST); 22 myoepithelial carcinomas of soft tissue; 7 anaplastic large cell lymphomas; 5 histiocytic sarcomas; and 10 control MRT of infancy (4 brain, 3 liver, 2 soft tissue, 1 kidney). Immunohistochemistry was performed following pressure cooker heat-induced epitope retrieval using monoclonal antibody BAF47 (BD Biosciences). In total, 127 of 136 (93\%) ES cases showed complete absence of INI1 expression, including 58 (91\%) conventional ES, 61 (95\%) proximal-type ES, and all 8 (100\%) hybrid ES. Of the non-ES cases, 12 (50\%) epithelioid MPNST also showed loss of INI1, as did 2 (9\%) myoepithelial carcinomas and all control MRT cases. INI1 expression was intact in all other tumor types examined. In conclusion, similar to MRT of infancy, loss of INI1 expression is characteristic of both conventional and proximal-type ES, being detected in {\textgreater}90\% of cases. Moreover, 50\% epithelioid MPNST and occasional myoepithelial carcinomas are also negative for INI1. Immunostaining for INI1 can be used to confirm the diagnosis of ES in the appropriate context. Loss of INI1 expression may also be helpful to distinguish epithelioid MPNST from metastatic melanoma in a subset of cases.},

	abstract = {The mitogenic activity of several growth factors is mediated by calcium-dependent signal transduction. Calmodulin (CaM) binding proteins such as CaM-dependent protein kinases are important components of this pathway and may be altered in diseases characterized by abnormal cell growth. CaM kinase II is believed to regulate the phosphorylation of microtubular-associated proteins and control the initiation of DNA synthesis. Furthermore, drugs that inhibit CaM-mediated signal transduction also inhibit cellular proliferation and are cytotoxic to numerous malignant cell lines, including those established from malignant gliomas. Yet, little is known about CaM-dependent protein kinases in these tumors. Therefore, we have investigated the activity and distribution of CaM-dependent protein kinase II in normal and malignant glial tissues, a kinase believed to play a critical role in cell cycle regulation. C6 and 9L cells contained kinase activities that were activated by Ca2+/CaM and inhibited by trifluoperazine. Tissue extracts from these cell lines and from rat brain white matter phosphorylated exogenous synapsin I in a pattern consistent with the presence of CaM kinase II activity as determined by phosphopeptide mapping. CaM kinase II activity was confirmed using a specific peptide substrate and inhibitor. An unexpected finding was that glioma lines, but not rat brain white matter, also contained a CaM-dependent protein kinase detected by the phosphorylation of a M(r) 100,000 protein, subsequently identified as elongation factor 2, the only known substrate for CaM kinase III.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Changes in cancer incidence rates from 1975 through 2003 are summarized by annual percent change for time periods determined by joinpoint regression analysis. After initial stability (1975-1979), incidence rates in women for all cancer sites combined increased from 1979 through 2003, although the rate of increase has recently slowed. For men, initial increases in all cancer sites combined (1975-1992) are followed by decreasing incidence rates (1992-1995) and stable trends from 1995 through 2003. Female thyroid cancer shows continued increasing incidence rates from 1981 through 2003. Blacks have the highest incidence and mortality rates for men and women for all cancer sites combined. Based on 2001 through 2003 data, the likelihood of developing cancer during one's lifetime is approximately one in two for men and one in three for women. Five-year relative survival for all stages combined (1996-2002) ranges from 16\% for lung to 100\% for prostate cancer patients. Cancer survival varies by stage of disease and race, with lower survival in blacks compared with whites. The risk of developing subsequent multiple primary cancers varies from 1\% for an initial liver primary diagnosis to 16\% for initial bladder cancer primaries. The impact on the future U.S. cancer burden is estimated based on the growing and aging U.S. population.

	abstract = {Metastasis, the dissemination and growth of neoplastic cells in an organ distinct from that in which they originated, is the most common cause of death in cancer patients. This is particularly true for pancreatic cancers, where most patients are diagnosed with metastatic disease and few show a sustained response to chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Whether the dismal prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer compared to patients with other types of cancer is a result of late diagnosis or early dissemination of disease to distant organs is not known. Here we rely on data generated by sequencing the genomes of seven pancreatic cancer metastases to evaluate the clonal relationships among primary and metastatic cancers. We find that clonal populations that give rise to distant metastases are represented within the primary carcinoma, but these clones are genetically evolved from the original parental, non-metastatic clone. Thus, genetic heterogeneity of metastases reflects that within the primary carcinoma. A quantitative analysis of the timing of the genetic evolution of pancreatic cancer was performed, indicating at least a decade between the occurrence of the initiating mutation and the birth of the parental, non-metastatic founder cell. At least five more years are required for the acquisition of metastatic ability and patients die an average of two years thereafter. These data provide novel insights into the genetic features underlying pancreatic cancer progression and define a broad time window of opportunity for early detection to prevent deaths from metastatic disease.},

We derive compact analytical approximations for the fixation probability and the distribution of passage times for the beneficial allele to reach a given intermediate frequency. We apply the formalism to several biologically relevant scenarios, such as linear or cyclic changes in the selection coefficient, and logistic population growth. Comparison with computer simulations shows that the analytical results are accurate for a large parameter range, as long as selection is not very weak.},

	abstract = {Glioblastomas (GBMs) are devastating tumors of the central nervous system, with a poor prognosis of 1-year survival. This results from a high resistance of GBM tumor cells to current therapeutic options, including etoposide (VP-16). Understanding resistance mechanisms may thus open new therapeutic avenues. VP-16 is a topoisomerase inhibitor that causes replication fork stalling and, ultimately, the formation of DNA double-strand breaks and apoptotic cell death. Autophagy has been identified as a VP-16 treatment resistance mechanism in tumor cells. Retinoblastoma protein (RB) is a classical tumor suppressor owing to its role in G1/S cell cycle checkpoint, but recent data have shown RB participation in many other cellular functions, including, counterintuitively, negative regulation of apoptosis. As GBMs usually display an amplification of the EGFR signaling involving the RB protein pathway, we questioned whether RB might be involved in mechanisms of resistance of GBM cells to VP-16. We observed that RB silencing increased VP-16-induced DNA double-strand breaks and p53 activation. Moreover, RB knockdown increased VP-16-induced apoptosis in GBM cell lines and cancer stem cells, the latter being now recognized essential to resistance to treatments and recurrence. We also showed that VP-16 treatment induced autophagy, and that RB silencing impaired this process by inhibiting the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. Taken together, our data suggest that RB silencing causes a blockage on the VP-16-induced autophagic flux, which is followed by apoptosis in GBM cell lines and in cancer stem cells. Therefore, we show here, for the first time, that RB represents a molecular link between autophagy and apoptosis, and a resistance marker in GBM, a discovery with potential importance for anticancer treatment.},

Because of technical limitations in current collection and recording methods, most gene expression measurements are carried out on populations of cells and therefore reflect average mRNA levels. The variability of the transcript levels between different cells remains undefined, although it may have profound effects on cellular activities. Here we have measured gene expression levels of the five genes ActB, Ins1, Ins2, Abcc8, and Kcnj11 in individual cells from mouse pancreatic islets. Whereas Ins1 and Ins2 expression show a strong cell–cell correlation, this is not the case for the other genes. We further found that the transcript levels of the different genes are lognormally distributed. Hence, the geometric mean of expression levels provides a better estimate of gene activity of the typical cell than does the arithmetic mean measured on a cell population.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heterogeneity within a given cancer arises from diverse cell types recruited to the tumor and from genetic and/or epigenetic differences amongst the cancer cells themselves. These factors conspire to create a disease with various phenotypes. There are 2 established models of cancer development and progression to metastatic disease. These are the clonal evolution and cancer stem cell models.
CONTENT: The clonal evolution theory suggests that successive mutations accumulating in a given cell generate clonal outgrowths that thrive in response to microenvironmental selection pressures, dictating the phenotype of the tumor. The alternative cancer stem cell (CSC) model suggests that cancer cells with similar genetic backgrounds can be hierarchically organized according to their tumorigenic potential. Accordingly, CSCs reside at the apex of the hierarchy and are thought to possess the majority of a cancer's tumor-initiating and metastatic ability. A defining feature of this model is its apparent unidirectional nature, whereby CSCs undergo symmetric division to replenish the CSC pool and irreversible asymmetric division to generate daughter cells (non-CSCs) with low tumorigenic potential. However, evolving evidence supports a new model of tumorigenicity, in which considerable plasticity exists between the non-CSC and CSC compartments, such that non-CSCs can reacquire a CSC phenotype. These findings suggest that some tumors may adhere to a plastic CSC model, in which bidirectional conversions are common and essential components of tumorigenicity.
SUMMARY: Accumulating evidence surrounding the plasticity of cancer cells, in particular, suggests that aggressive CSCs can be created de novo within a tumor. Given the current focus on therapeutic targeting of CSCs, we discuss the implications of non-CSC-to-CSC conversions on the development of future therapies.},

Besides binding ligands actively participating in inflammation and immune responses, RAGE serves as an endothelial adhesion receptor for leukocyte integrins and promotes leukocyte recruitment and extravasation of infiltrating cells. Engagement of RAGE subsequently converts transient cellular stimulation into sustained cellular dysfunction driven by long-term activation of the proinflammatory nuclear factor-kappaB.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Antiangiogenic therapy is effective in blocking vascular permeability, inhibiting vascular proliferation, and slowing tumor growth, but studies in multiple cancer types have shown that tumors eventually acquire resistance to blockade of blood vessel growth. Currently, the mechanisms by which this resistance occurs are not well understood.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this study, we evaluated the effects of neutrophils on glioma biology both in vitro and in vivo and determined target genes by which neutrophils promote the malignant glioma phenotype during anti-VEGF therapy.
RESULTS: We found that an increase in neutrophil infiltration into tumors is significantly correlated with glioma grade and in glioblastoma with acquired resistance to anti-VEGF therapy. Our data demonstrate that neutrophils and their condition media increased the proliferation rate of glioblastoma-initiating cells (GIC). In addition, neutrophils significantly increased GICs Transwell migration compared with controls. Consistent with this behavior, coculture with neutrophils promoted GICs to adopt morphologic and gene expression changes consistent with a mesenchymal signature. Neutrophil-promoting tumor progression could be blocked by S100A4 downregulation in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, S100A4 depletion increased the effectiveness of anti-VEGF therapy in glioma.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these data suggest that increased recruitment of neutrophils during anti-VEGF therapy promotes glioma progression and may promote treatment resistance. Tumor progression with mesenchymal characteristics is partly mediated by S100A4, the expression of which is increased by neutrophil infiltration. Targeting granulocytes and S100A4 may be effective approaches to inhibit the glioma malignant phenotype and diminish antiangiogenic therapy resistance.},

The amount of COX-2 mRNA (relative to 28S rRNA) was 22\% lower (P = 0.04) in older muscle, and the amount of mtDNA (relative to nuclear DNA) was 38\% lower (P = 0.0002). The average level of mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam), a protein essential for mtDNA replication, was similar in younger and older muscle. Tfam mRNA, nuclear respiratory factor-1 mRNA, and several mRNAs encoding proteins required for mtDNA replication were expressed at similar levels in younger and older muscle. The mtDNA concentrations were only weakly related to age-adjusted aerobic fitness (maximal oxygen consumption) and self-reported physical activity levels. We conclude that the lower concentration of mitochondrial mRNAs in older muscle can be explained by a reduced concentration of mtDNA.},

	abstract = {Cancer therapy, even when highly targeted, typically fails because of the remarkable capacity of malignant cells to evolve effective adaptations. These evolutionary dynamics are both a cause and a consequence of cancer system heterogeneity at many scales, ranging from genetic properties of individual cells to large-scale imaging features. Tumors of the same organ and cell type can have remarkably diverse appearances in different patients. Furthermore, even within a single tumor, marked variations in imaging features, such as necrosis or contrast enhancement, are common. Similar spatial variations recently have been reported in genetic profiles. Radiologic heterogeneity within tumors is usually governed by variations in blood flow, whereas genetic heterogeneity is typically ascribed to random mutations. However, evolution within tumors, as in all living systems, is subject to Darwinian principles; thus, it is governed by predictable and reproducible interactions between environmental selection forces and cell phenotype (not genotype). This link between regional variations in environmental properties and cellular adaptive strategies may permit clinical imaging to be used to assess and monitor intratumoral evolution in individual patients. This approach is enabled by new methods that extract, report, and analyze quantitative, reproducible, and mineable clinical imaging data. However, most current quantitative metrics lack spatialness, expressing quantitative radiologic features as a single value for a region of interest encompassing the whole tumor. In contrast, spatially explicit image analysis recognizes that tumors are heterogeneous but not well mixed and defines regionally distinct habitats, some of which appear to harbor tumor populations that are more aggressive and less treatable than others. By identifying regional variations in key environmental selection forces and evidence of cellular adaptation, clinical imaging can enable us to define intratumoral Darwinian dynamics before and during therapy. Advances in image analysis will place clinical imaging in an increasingly central role in the development of evolution-based patient-specific cancer therapy. © RSNA, 2013.},

	abstract = {Background
Mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with various aging diseases. The copy number of mtDNA in human cells may therefore be a potential biomarker for diagnostics of aging. Here we propose a new computational method for the accurate assessment of mtDNA copies from whole genome sequencing data.

Results
Two families of the human whole genome sequencing datasets from the HapMap and the 1000 Genomes projects were used for the accurate counting of mitochondrial DNA copy numbers. The results revealed the parental mitochondrial DNA copy numbers are significantly lower than that of their children in these samples. There are 8\%{\textasciitilde}21\% more copies of mtDNA in samples from the children than from their parents. The experiment demonstrated the possible correlations between the quantity of mitochondrial DNA and aging-related diseases.

Conclusions
Since the next-generation sequencing technology strives to deliver affordable and non-biased sequencing results, accurate assessment of mtDNA copy numbers can be achieved effectively from the output of whole genome sequencing. We implemented the method as a software package MitoCounter with the source code and user's guide available to the public at http://sourceforge.net/projects/mitocounter/.},

A total of 35\% of MT/ret mice develop a vitiligo, a skin depigmentation attributable to the lysis of normal melanocytes, associated with a delay in tumor progression. Here, we find that regulatory CD4(+) T cells accumulate in the skin, the spleen, and tumor-draining lymph nodes of MT/ret mice not developing vitiligo. Regulatory T-cell depletion and IL-10 neutralization led to increased occurrence of vitiligo that correlated with a decreased incidence of melanoma metastases. In contrast, inflammatory monocytes/dendritic cells accumulate in the skin of MT/ret mice with active vitiligo. Moreover, they inhibit tumor cell proliferation in vitro through a reactive oxygen species-dependent mechanism, and both their depletion and reactive oxygen species neutralization in vivo increased tumor cell dissemination. Altogether, our data suggest that regulatory CD4(+) T cells favor tumor progression, in part, by inhibiting recruitment and/or differentiation of inflammatory monocytes in the skin.},

Niacin deficiency in humans, which leads to low NAD status, causes sun sensitivity in skin, indicative of deficiencies in responding to UV damage. Animal models of niacin deficiency demonstrate genomic instability and increased cancer development in sensitive tissues including skin. Cell culture models of niacin deficiency have allowed the identification of NAD-dependent signaling events critical in early skin carcinogenesis. Niacin restriction in immortalized keratinocytes leads to an increased expression and activity of NADPH oxidase resulting in an accumulation of ROS, providing a potential survival mechanism as has been shown to occur in cancer cells. Niacin deficient keratinocytes are more sensitive to photodamage, as both poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases and Sirtuins are inhibited by the unavailability of their substrate, NAD+, leading to unrepaired DNA damage upon photodamage and a subsequent increase in cell death. Furthermore, the identification of the nicotinic acid receptor in human skin keratinocytes provides a further link to niacin's role as a potential skin cancer prevention agent and suggests the nicotinic acid receptor as a potential target for skin cancer prevention agents.

METHODS: We analyzed 16 tumors under three years of age: seven medulloblastomas, three anaplastic ependymomas (E IIIs), two each of supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors (sPNETs) and choroid plexus carcinomas (CPCs), and one each of neuroblastoma and pineoblastoma. Immunohistochemistry for glial fibrillary acidic protein, vimentin, epithelial membrane antigen, smooth muscle actin and cyclin D1 was performed. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis with direct sequencing, differential PCR and microsatellite analysis were conducted for hSNF5/INI1mutation, homozygous deletion and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on 22q, respectively. Because of the presence of rhabdoid cells and the polyimmunophenotypic features, the diagnosis was revised to AT/RT in five (31\%) tumors, namely, two E IIIs and one each of medulloblastoma, CPC and pineoblastoma. Three of them harbored such hSNF5/INI1 aberrations as germline single base deletion (492/6 delC) and missense mutation (C157T) together with LOH 22q or homozygous deletion. Cyclin D1 was overexpressed in those three tumors but not in the two that lacked hSNF5/INI1 inactivation.
CONCLUSION: AT/RT can be misdiagnosed as a variety of tumors, including ependymoma that potentially harbors LOH 22q. Our data indicate that cyclin D1 is a target of hSNF5/INI1in primary tumors.},

	abstract = {S100A4, a member of the S100 family of Ca(2+)-binding proteins, regulates carcinoma cell motility via interactions with myosin-IIA. Numerous studies indicate that S100A4 is not simply a marker for metastatic disease, but rather has a direct role in metastatic progression. These observations suggest that S100A4 is an excellent target for therapeutic intervention. Using a unique biosensor-based assay, trifluoperazine (TFP) was identified as an inhibitor that disrupts the S100A4/myosin-IIA interaction. To examine the interaction of S100A4 with TFP, we determined the 2.3 A crystal structure of human Ca(2+)-S100A4 bound to TFP. Two TFP molecules bind within the hydrophobic target binding pocket of Ca(2+)-S100A4 with no significant conformational changes observed in the protein upon complex formation. NMR chemical shift perturbations are consistent with the crystal structure and demonstrate that TFP binds to the target binding cleft of S100A4 in solution. Remarkably, TFP binding results in the assembly of five Ca(2+)-S100A4/TFP dimers into a tightly packed pentameric ring. Within each pentamer most of the contacts between S100A4 dimers occurs through the TFP moieties. The Ca(2+)-S100A4/prochlorperazine (PCP) complex exhibits a similar pentameric assembly. Equilibrium sedimentation and cross-linking studies demonstrate the cooperative formation of a similarly sized S100A4/TFP oligomer in solution. Assays examining the ability of TFP to block S100A4-mediated disassembly of myosin-IIA filaments demonstrate that significant inhibition of S100A4 function occurs only at TFP concentrations that promote S100A4 oligomerization. Together these studies support a unique mode of inhibition in which phenothiazines disrupt the S100A4/myosin-IIA interaction by sequestering S100A4 via small molecule-induced oligomerization.},

Necrosis is crucial to the damage that injury and disease inflict on the nervous system. Recent discoveries have shed light onto the molecular requirements for necrosis, and provide new evidence that, as is the case for apoptosis, the mechanisms of necrotic cell death are conserved from nematodes to humans. But in contrast to apoptotic mechanisms, necrotic mechanisms did not evolve specifically to carry out necrosis. Instead, under extreme circumstances, normal cellular activities are destabilized with devastating consequences for the cell. Here, we review the mechanisms that are implicated in necrosis and discuss the events that transform them to catastrophic for cell survival.},

	abstract = {Somatic mutations and large-scale depletion in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) have been extensively detected in various human cancers. However, it still remains unclear whether the alterations in mtDNA content are related to the clinicopathological parameters and patient prognosis in breast cancer. In the present study, we analyzed the copy number of mtDNA in 59 cases of invasive breast tumors and paired nontumorous tissues using quantitative real-time PCR. Our data showed that the level of mtDNA was significantly decreased in tumor tissues as compared to the adjacent nontumorous counterparts (P = 0.001). The reduced copy number in mtDNA was associated with an older onset age ({\textgreater}or=50 years old, P = 0.035) as well as a higher histological grade (P = 0.012). Survival analysis measured by the Kaplan-Meier curves and the log-rank test indicated that patients with reduced mtDNA content had significantly poorer disease-free survival (DFS, P = 0.0079) and overall survival (OS, P = 0.011) rate. In addition, tumors harboring mutations in displacement (D)-loop region, particularly at the polycytidine stretch (T/N ratio = 64.3 +/- 8.2\%) or close to the replication origins of the heavy-strand (T/N ratio = 68.7 +/- 5.5\%), had a significantly lower copy number of mtDNA than the ones without D-loop alterations. Together, our results suggested that reduced copy number of mtDNA may be involved in breast neoplastic transformation or progression and mtDNA content might be potentially used as a tool to predict prognosis. Somatic mutation in the D-loop region probably is one of key contributing factors leading to decreased mtDNA level in breast tumors.},

These Lgr5+ cells, which represent about 5 to 10\% of the cells in the adenomas, generate additional Lgr5+ cells as well as all other adenoma cell types.

	abstract = {Although it is well-known that cancers show intratumoral phenotypic heterogeneity, genotypic studies have been scarce. Using comparative genomic hybridization and laser scanning cytometric analyses, we investigated intratumoral cytogenetic heterogeneity in 21 surgically removed gliomas including 11 glioblastomas (GBMs), 8 anaplastic astrocytomas (AAs) and 2 low-grade astrocytomas. Comparative genomic hybridization analysis revealed gain or amplification of 7p in 63\%, gain of 7q in 73\%, loss of 9p in 53\%, loss of 10p in 47\%, loss of 10q in 47\%, loss of 13q in 53\%, and loss of 22q in 37\% of high-grade astrocytomas. Because these aberrations were region-independent within the same tumor, they did not contribute to intratumoral cytogenetic heterogeneity. Such heterogeneity was due to cytogenetic changes other than the above region-independent aberrations. Intratumoral cytogenetic heterogeneity was detected in 8 of 11 GBMs, 4 of 8 AAs, and none of the 2 low-grade astrocytomas. These observations suggest that cytogenetic changes at chromosomes 7, 9p, 10, 13, and 22 are primary events in high-grade astrocytomas and that subsequent cytogenetic changes involving increases in copy number provide intratumoral heterogeneity. DNA aneuploidy was detected by laser scanning cytometry in 5 of 11 GBMs and 1 of 8 AAs. All tumors with DNA aneuploidy exhibited intratumoral cytogenetic heterogeneity, and there was a significant correlation between DNA aneuploidy and intratumoral cytogenetic heterogeneity. These results support the notion that cytogenetic heterogeneity results from genetic instability within a tumor.},

After tissue selection, about 12–16 extractions of DNA, RNA or protein can be obtained per day. Compared with other similar approaches, this fast and reliable methodology allowed us to identify mutations in tumors with remarkable sensitivity and to perform integrative analyses of whole-genome and exome data sets, DNA copy numbers (by single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays), gene expression data (by transcriptome profiling and quantitative PCR (qPCR)) and protein levels (by western blotting and immunohistochemical analysis) from the same samples.

	abstract = {In terms of evolution and fitness, the most significant spontaneous mutation rate is likely to be that for the entire genome (or its nonfrivolous fraction). Information is now available to calculate this rate for several DNA-based haploid microbes, including bacteriophages with single- or double-stranded DNA, a bacterium, a yeast, and a filamentous fungus. Their genome sizes vary by approximately 6500-fold. Their average mutation rates per base pair vary by approximately 16,000-fold, whereas their mutation rates per genome vary by only approximately 2.5-fold, apparently randomly, around a mean value of 0.0033 per DNA replication. The average mutation rate per base pair is inversely proportional to genome size. Therefore, a nearly invariant microbial mutation rate appears to have evolved. Because this rate is uniform in such diverse organisms, it is likely to be determined by deep general forces, perhaps by a balance between the usually deleterious effects of mutation and the physiological costs of further reducing mutation rates.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2148-10-298},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In any natural population, mutation is the primary source of genetic variation required for evolutionary novelty and adaptation. Nevertheless, most mutations, especially those with phenotypic effects, are harmful and are consequently removed by natural selection. For this reason, under natural selection, an organism will evolve to a lower mutation rate. Overall, the action of natural selection on mutation rate is related to population size and mutation effects. Although theoretical work has intensively investigated the relationship between natural selection and mutation rate, most of these studies have focused on individual competition within a population, rather than on competition among populations. The aim of the present study was to use computer simulations to investigate how natural selection adjusts mutation rate among asexually reproducing subpopulations with different mutation rates.
RESULTS: The competition results for the different subpopulations showed that a population could evolve to an "optimum" mutation rate during long-term evolution, and that this rate was modulated by both population size and mutation effects. A larger population could evolve to a higher optimum mutation rate than could a smaller population. The optimum mutation rate depended on both the fraction and the effects of beneficial mutations, rather than on the effects of deleterious ones. The optimum mutation rate increased with either the fraction or the effects of beneficial mutations. When strongly favored mutations appeared, the optimum mutation rate was elevated to a much higher level. The competition time among the subpopulations also substantially shortened.
CONCLUSIONS: Competition at the population level revealed that the evolution of the mutation rate in asexual populations was determined by both population size and mutation effects. The most striking finding was that beneficial mutations, rather than deleterious mutations, were the leading force that modulated the optimum mutation rate. The initial configuration of the population appeared to have no effect on these conclusions, confirming the robustness of the simulation method developed in the present study. These findings might further explain the lower mutation rates observed in most asexual organisms, as well as the higher mutation rates in some viruses.},

Because DNA aneuploidy is an indirect measure of the proliferative activity of a cell population, a study was conducted to examine differences in tumor response to induction chemotherapy based on aDI values. Pretreatment tumor specimens were obtained from 50 patients with stage III and IV laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma who underwent induction chemotherapy (cisplatin/5-FU). With the use of computerized cytomorphometry, DNA content and nuclear area were measured and associations with tumor site, stage, chemotherapy response, tumor recurrence, and survival were examined. An elevated aDI was more frequent in patients with a chemotherapeutic response (p = 0.08), and mean aDI was higher among the complete responders. There were no complete responders among patients with a low aDI value ({\textless} 0.024). Neither aDI nor nuclear area correlated significantly with organ preservation or patient survival. Our results indicate that a complete response is more likely for patients with tumors with an elevated aDI and that pretreatment aDI may be useful in selecting high-risk patients who might benefit from chemotherapy.},

All remaining cases had diploid stem lines. Diploidy was more common in infants with clinical Stage D neuroblastoma (metastases beyond regional lymph nodes) than in those with other, less advanced stages: 6 of 10 as compared with 2 of 25 (P = 0.003). Of 17 evaluable patients with unresectable hyperdiploid tumors, 15 had complete responses and two had partial responses to cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin; six others with diploid tumors did not respond (P = 0.00001). We also found that each of the four infants with Evans' Stage IV-S neuroblastoma, an unusual form of disseminated neuroblastoma with a relatively good prognosis, had hyperdiploid tumor cells of clonal origin.

Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has been introduced as an important method for mining biological data. Though there currently exists packages implemented in R and other programming languages, they either provide only a few optimization algorithms or focus on a specific application field. There does not exist a complete NMF package for the bioinformatics community, and in order to perform various data mining tasks on biological data.

Results
We provide a convenient MATLAB toolbox containing both the implementations of various NMF techniques and a variety of NMF-based data mining approaches for analyzing biological data. Data mining approaches implemented within the toolbox include data clustering and bi-clustering, feature extraction and selection, sample classification, missing values imputation, data visualization, and statistical comparison.

Conclusions
A series of analysis such as molecular pattern discovery, biological process identification, dimension reduction, disease prediction, visualization, and statistical comparison can be performed using this toolbox.},

Altogether four blood samples per patient were collected: before and after receiving the first dose of radiotherapy, in the middle of radiotherapy cycle, and after the last dose of radiotherapy. The results indicate that after the first radiation dose significantly increased levels of DNA damage were recorded in almost all cancer patients compared to their baseline values. Specific patterns of DNA damage were recorded in samples analyzed in the middle of radiotherapy and after receiving the last dose, indicating the possibility of adaptive response in some patients. Our results indicate that persistence of post-irradiation damage in peripheral blood leukocytes (and possibly in other non-target cells) of cancer patients that are strong determinants for the secondary cancer risk.

	abstract = {Glioblastoma multiforme is an aggressive form of brain cancer that responds poorly to chemotherapy and is generally incurable. The basis for the poor response of this cancer to chemotherapy is not well understood. The atypical protein kinases C (PKC and PKC) have previously been implicated in leukaemia cell chemoresistance. To assess the role of atypical PKC in glioblastoma cell chemoresistance, RNA interference was used to deplete human glioblastoma cells of PKC. Transfection of cells with either of two different RNA duplexes specific for PKC caused a partial sensitisation to cell death induced by the chemotherapy agent cisplatin. To screen for possible mechanisms for PKC-mediated chemoresistance, microarray analysis of gene expression was performed on RNA from glioblastoma cells that were either untreated or depleted of PKC. This identified sets of genes that were regulated either positively or negatively by PKC. Within the set of genes that were negatively regulated by PKC, the function of the gene coding for GMF, an enhancer of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) signaling, was investigated further, as the p38 MAP kinase pathway has been previously identified as a key mediator of cisplatin cytotoxicity. The expression of both GMF mRNA and protein increased upon PKC depletion, and this was accompanied by an increase in cisplatin-activated p38 MAP kinase signaling. Transient overexpression of GMF increased cisplatin-activated p38 MAP kinase signaling and also sensitised cells to cisplatin cytotoxicity. The increase in cisplatin cytotoxicity seen with PKC depletion was blocked by the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SKF86002. These data show that PKC can confer partial resistance to cisplatin in glioblastoma cells by suppressing GMF-mediated enhancement of p38 MAP kinase signaling.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Cisplatin and temozolomide (TMZ) are active in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), with different profiles of toxicity. A bid regimen of TMZ achieves a strong inhibition of O(6)-alkylguanine DNA-alkyl transferase (AGAT), and cisplatin reduces AGAT activity in vitro, suggesting a possible synergic interaction. The primary end point of the present multicenter phase II study was progression-free survival (PFS) at 6 months (PFS-6); secondary end points included response, toxicity, and overall survival.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Chemotherapy-naive patients with GBM who experienced disease recurrence or progression after surgery and standard radiotherapy were eligible. Chemotherapy cycles consisted of cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) on day 1, TMZ 130 mg/m(2) bolus followed by nine doses of 70 mg/m(2) every 12 hours (total of 5 days) from day 2 every 4 weeks. In the absence of hematologic toxicity, TMZ was escalated to 1,000 mg/m(2) in 5 days.
RESULTS: A total of 50 patients (median age, 53.4 years; range, 27 to 70 years; median Karnofsky performance status, 80; range, 60 to 100) were accrued in the study. PFS-6 was 34\% (95\% CI, 23\% to 50\%), and PFS-12 was 4\% (95\% CI, 0.3\% to 16\%). Median PFS was 18.4 weeks (95\% CI, 13 to 25.9 weeks). Among 49 assessable patients, one complete response and nine partial responses were obtained, with an overall response rate of 20.4\% (95\% CI, 7.7\% to 33\%). Among 203 treatment cycles delivered, the most common grade 3 or grade 4 events included granulocytopenia in 7.9\% of cycles, thrombocytopenia in 4\%, and neurologic toxicity in three patients (6\%).
CONCLUSION: The new cisplatin plus bid TMZ regimen appears active in chemotherapy-naive patients with recurrent GBM and incurs an acceptable toxicity.},

This phase II study (NCT00423150) investigated whether MGMT promoter methylation predicts response in patients with advanced aerodigestive tract and colorectal cancers (CRC). Tumor and serum samples were screened for MGMT promoter methylation. In methylation-positive patients, 150 mg/m2 temozolomide was administered daily on a seven-day-on, seven-day-off schedule for each 28-day cycle. The primary efficacy endpoint was response rate (RR). MMR status was determined by a microsatellite instability assay. Among 740 patients screened, 86 were positive for MGMT promoter methylation and enrolled. Nineteen percent of the screened population (137/740) had confirmed tissue and/or serum MGMT promoter methylation, including 25\% (57 of 229) for CRC, 36\% (55 of 154) for esophageal cancer, 11\% (12 of 113) for head and neck cancer, and 5\% (13 of 242) for non–small cell lung carcinoma. Among patients with valid methylation results in both tissue and serum samples, concordance was 81\% (339 of 419). The majority of enrolled patients (69 of 86; 80\%) had microsatellite stable cancer. Overall RR was 6\% (5 of 86 partial responses); all responders had microsatellite stable cancer. Temozolomide resulted in low RRs in patients enriched for MGMT methylation. MGMT methylation status varied considerably in the patient population. Although serum methylation assay is an option for promoter methylation detection, tissue assay remains the standard for methylation detection. The low RR of this cohort of patients indicates that MGMT methylation as a biomarker is not applicable to heterogeneous tumor types, and tumor-specific factors may override validated biomarkers.

But median survival time among the responders (partial remission and clinical improvement) and of the patients with unchanged findings was significantly longer (8.4 or 7.4 months, respectively) than that among patients with progression (4.5 months). Analysis of prognostic factors in terms of survival curves revealed no difference between patients with or without measurable tumor parameters, with or without local recurrences or liver metastases. However, there was a statistically significant worsening of prognosis for patients whose initial general state was reduced, who had lung metastases or increased WBC counts. Side effects were relatively mild with both therapy regimens, except for alopecia with FAB. After the second treatment cycle myelosuppression was more marked with FAB than FB.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pathway based microarray analysis is an effort to integrate microarray and pathway data in a holistic analytical approach, looking for coordinated changes in the expression of sets of genes forming pathways. However, it has been observed that the results produced are often cryptic, with cases of closely related genes in a pathway showing quite variable, even opposing expression.
OBJECTIVES: We propose a methodology to identify the state of activation of individual pathways, based on our hypothesis that gene members of many pathways or modules exhibit differential expression that results from their contribution to any combination of all their constituent pathways. Therefore, the observed expression of such a gene does not necessarily imply the activation state of a given pathway where its product participates, but reflects the net expression resulting from its participation in all its constituent pathways.
METHODS: Firstly, in an effort to validate the hypothesis, we split the genes into two groups; single and multi-membership. We then determined and compared the proportion of differentially expressed genes in each group, for each experiment. In addition, we estimated the cumulative binomial probability of observing as many or more expressed genes in each group, in each experiment, simply by chance. Second, we propose a hill climbing methodology, aiming to maximise the agreement of gene expression per module.
RESULTS: We detected more frequent expression of multi-membership genes and significantly lower probabilities of observing such a high proportion of differentially expressed multi-membership genes, as the one present in the dataset. The algorithm was able to correctly identify the state of activation of the KEGG glycolysis and gluconeogenesis modules, using a number of Saccharomyces cerevisiae datasets. We show that the result is equivalent to the best solution found following exhaustive search.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method takes into account the multi-membership nature of genes and our knowledge of the competitive nature of our exemplar modules, revealing the state of activity of a pathway.},

A fundamental statistical issue in clustering is which clusters are "really there", as opposed to being artifacts of the natural sampling variation. We propose SigClust as a simple and natural approach to this fundamental statistical problem. In particular, we define a cluster as data coming from a single Gaussian distribution and formulate the problem of assessing statistical significance of clustering as a testing procedure. This Gaussian null assumption allows direct formulation of p values that effectively quantify the significance of a given clustering. HDLSS covariance estimation for SigClust is achieved by a combination of invariance principles, together with a factor analysis model. The properties of SigClust are studied. Simulated examples, as well as an application to a real cancer microarray data set, show that the proposed method works remarkably well for assessing significance of clustering. Some theoretical results also are obtained.},

An analytical expression is given which allows straight computation of highly accurate values of error thresholds. The error threshold can be expanded in a power series of the reciprocal square root of the population size and thus increases with 1/√N in sufficiently large populations.},

To address these challenges, we developed a computational approach based on standard hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue sections and demonstrated its power in a discovery and validation cohort of 323 and 241 breast tumors, respectively. To deconvolute cellular heterogeneity and detect subtle genomic aberrations, we introduced an algorithm based on tumor cellularity to increase the comparability of copy number profiles between samples. We next devised a predictor for survival in estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer that integrated both image-based and gene expression analyses and significantly outperformed classifiers that use single data types, such as microarray expression signatures. Image processing also allowed us to describe and validate an independent prognostic factor based on quantitative analysis of spatial patterns between stromal cells, which are not detectable by molecular assays.

This, like similar chemotherapeutic regimens, induces response rates of 60\% to 80\%, with a median response duration of under 2 years. Rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against CD20, is active in follicular lymphoma, both as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy. Previously untreated patients with stages III to IV follicular lymphoma were randomly assigned to receive either 8 cycles of CVP plus rituximab (R-CVP; n = 162) or CVP (n = 159). Overall and complete response rates were 81\% and 41\% in the R-CVP arm versus 57\% and 10\% in the CVP arm, respectively (P {\textless} .0001). At a median follow-up of 30 months, patients treated with R-CVP had a very significantly prolonged time to progression (median 32 months versus 15 months for CVP; P {\textless} .0001). Median time to treatment failure was 27 months in patients receiving R-CVP and 7 months in the CVP arm (P {\textless} .0001). Rituximab did not add significantly to the toxicity of CVP. The addition of rituximab to the CVP regimen significantly improves the clinical outcome in patients with previously untreated advanced follicular lymphoma, without increased toxicity.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and mitoxantrone (FCM) results in a high response rate in previously treated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The aim of this study was to investigate FCM as frontline therapy in CLL.
Experimental Design: Sixty-nine patients under the age of 65 years with active CLL were treated. Patients received six cycles of fludarabine 25 mg/m2 i.v. × 3 days, cyclophosphamide 200 mg/m2 i.v. × 3 days, and mitoxantrone 6 mg/m2 i.v. × 1 day. Treatment outcome was correlated with clinical and biological variables. The clinical significance of eradicating minimal residual disease (MRD) was also analyzed.
Results: The overall response, MRD-negative complete response (CR), MRD-positive CR, nodular partial response (PR), and PR rates were 90\%, 26\%, 38\%, 14\%, and 12\%, respectively. Severe (grades 3 or 4) neutropenia developed in 10\% of the patients. Major and minor infections were reported in 1\% and 8\% of cases, respectively. Median response duration was 37 months. Patients with del(17p) failed to attain CR. Patients achieving MRD-negative CR had a longer response duration and overall survival than patients with an inferior response. Low serum lactate dehydrogenase levels, low ZAP-70 expression, and mutated IgVH genes predicted longer response duration. Finally, both low ZAP-70 and CD38 expression in leukemic cells correlated with MRD-negativity achievement.
Conclusion: FCM induces a high response rate, including MRD-negative CRs in untreated patients with active CLL. Treatment toxicity is acceptable. Both high ZAP-70 and increased CD38 expression predict failure to obtain MRD-negative response. Patients in whom MRD can be eradicated have longer response duration and overall survival than those with inferior response. These results indicate that FCM can be an ideal companion for chemoimmunotherapy of patients with CLL.},

	abstract = {Docetaxel has come into wide use recently for the treatment of breast cancer in neoadjuvant, adjuvant and metastatic settings. Docetaxel binds to β-tubulin and causes kinetic abnormalities in the dynamics of microtubules by increasing their polymerization and inhibiting their depolymerization, resulting in elevated levels of microtubule formation. During metaphase, defective spindle formation induced by docetaxel activates the mitotic checkpoint and leads to cell cycle arrest, culminating in apoptosis. However, docetaxel is not effective for all breast cancers. For example, in metastatic settings, the response rate to docetaxel reportedly ranges from 30 to 50\%. It is therefore very important to develop a diagnostic method with high accuracy for the prediction of sensitivity to docetaxel in order to avoid unnecessary treatment. Currently it is impossible to identify, before the initiation of therapy, the patients for whom docetaxel will be effective. Various biological parameters have been studied clinically for their ability to predict response to docetaxel, such as parameters related to: (1) efflux (p-glycoprotein) and metabolism (CYP3A4); (2) β-tubulin (somatic mutation of β-tubulin and changes in β-tubulin isotypes levels); (3) cell cycle (HER2, BRCA1 and Aurora-A); and (4) apoptosis (p53, BCL2 and thioredoxin). More recently, gene expression profiling techniques have been used for the development of a prediction model for response to docetaxel. In the present paper, clinical studies that have been conducted recently to identify predictive factors for response to docetaxel are reviewed together with a presentation of our recent work in this field.

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is initially a chemosensitive disease, but relapse is common, and in this group of patients it remains a rapidly lethal disease with a particularly poor prognosis. The choice of second-line chemotherapy for patients with relapsed SCLC has been an area of difficulty for oncologists, and until recently there was no randomized evidence for its use over best supportive care (BSC). Topotecan is currently the only drug licensed in Europe and the U.S. for this indication, having been shown in a phase III trial to lead to longer overall survival and better quality of life than with BSC. In this article, we review the current evidence for the use of second-line cytotoxic therapy and also the emerging role of novel agents and targeted therapies in this setting. In particular, we explore the role of the Bcl-2 protein family, which are key regulators of mitochondrial apoptosis and are implicated in resistance to anticancer therapies. SCLC overexpresses antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family in ∼80\% of cases. Several Bcl-2 inhibitors, including obatoclax, are currently entering clinical trials in SCLC and are an exciting area of drug development in the relapsed setting.},

We used BH3 profiling to measure priming in tumor cells from patients with multiple myeloma, acute myelogenous and lymphoblastic leukemia, and ovarian cancer. This assay measures mitochondrial response to peptides derived from proapoptotic BH3 domains of proteins critical for death signaling to mitochondria.

We review recent approaches to modeling the evolution of cancer, including population dynamics models of tumor initiation and progression, phylogenetic methods to model the evolutionary relationship between tumor subclones, and probabilistic graphical models to describe dependencies among mutations. Evolutionary modeling helps to understand how tumors arise and will also play an increasingly important prognostic role in predicting disease progression and the outcome of medical interventions, such as targeted therapy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We evaluated whether next generation sequencing (NGS) of cfDNA could be used for patient selection and as a tumor clone response biomarker in patients with advanced cancers participating in early phase clinical trials of targeted drugs.
METHODS: Plasma samples from patients with known tumor mutations who completed at least 2 courses of investigational targeted therapy were collected monthly, until disease progression. NGS was performed sequentially on the Ion Torrent PGM platform.
RESULTS: cfDNA was extracted from 39 patients with various tumor types. Treatments administered targeted mailnly the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway (n=28) or MEK (n=7). Overall 159 plasma samples were sequenced with a mean sequencing coverage achieved of 1,685X across experiments. At trial initiation (C1D1), 23 of 39 (59\%) patients had at least one mutation identified in cfDNA (mean 2, range 1-5). TP53, PIK3CA and KRAS were the top 3 mutated genes identified, with 16 (39\%), 9 (22\%) and 8 (17\%) different mutations, respectively. Out of these 23 patients, 13 received a targeted drug matching their tumor profile. For the 23 patients with cfDNA mutation at C1D1, the monitoring of mutation allele frequency (AF) in consecutive plasma samples during treatment with targeted drugs demonstrated potential treatment associated clonal responses. Longitudinal monitoring of cfDNA samples with multiple mutations indicated the presence of separate clones behaving discordantly. Molecular changes at cfDNA mutation level were associated with time to disease progression by RECIST criteria.
CONCLUSION: Targeted NGS of cfDNA has potential clinical utility to monitor the delivery of targeted therapies.},

	abstract = {User experience with viewing images in pathology is crucial for accurate interpretation and diagnosis. With digital
pathology, images are being read on a display system, and this poses new types of questions: such as what is the
difference in terms of pixelation, refresh lag or obscured features compared to an optical microscope. Is there a resultant change in user performance in terms of speed of slide review, perception of adequacy and quality or in diagnostic confidence? A prior psychophysical study was carried out comparing various display modalities on whole slide imaging (WSI) in pathology at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) in the USA. This prior study compared professional and non-professional grade display modalities and highlighted the importance of using a medical grade display to view pathological digital images. This study was duplicated in Europe at the Department of Pathology in Erasme Hospital (Université Libre de Bruxelles (ULB)) in an attempt to corroborate these findings. Digital WSI with corresponding glass slides of 58 cases including surgical pathology and cytopathology slides of varying difficulty were employed. Similar non-professional and professional grade display modalities were compared to an optical microscope (Olympus BX51). Displays ranged from a laptop (DELL Latitude D620), to a consumer grade display (DELL E248WFPb), to two professional grade monitors (Eizo CG245W and Barco MDCC-6130). Three pathologists were
selected from the Department of Pathology in Erasme Hospital (ULB) in Belgium to view and interpret the pathological
images on these different displays. The results show that non-professional grade displays (laptop and consumer) have
inferior user experience compared to professional grade monitors and the optical microscope.},

We precompute C scores for all 8.6 billion possible human single-nucleotide variants and enable scoring of short insertions-deletions. C scores correlate with allelic diversity, annotations of functionality, pathogenicity, disease severity, experimentally measured regulatory effects and complex trait associations, and they highly rank known pathogenic variants within individual genomes. The ability of CADD to prioritize functional, deleterious and pathogenic variants across many functional categories, effect sizes and genetic architectures is unmatched by any current single-annotation method.},

These indels are often small and difficult and laborious to detect by traditional methods. Here we present a method for fast, sensitive and simple indel detection that accurately defines indel sizes down to ±1 bp.

This technique has the advantage of potentially handling large genomic data sets. We find that a zeta power-law model of indel lengths provides a much better fit than the traditional geometric model and that indel processes are conserved between our taxa. The estimated relative rates are about 12–16 indels per 100 substitutions, and the estimated power-law magnitudes are about 1.6–1.7. More significantly, we find that using the traditional geometric/affine model of indel lengths introduces artifacts into evolutionary analysis, casting doubt on studies of the evolution and diversity of indel formation using traditional models and invalidating measures of species divergence that include indel lengths.},

By developing methods to integrate information across several algorithms and diverse data sources, we provide a validated haplotype map of 38 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1.4 million short insertions and deletions, and more than 14,000 larger deletions. We show that individuals from different populations carry different profiles of rare and common variants, and that low-frequency variants show substantial geographic differentiation, which is further increased by the action of purifying selection. We show that evolutionary conservation and coding consequence are key determinants of the strength of purifying selection, that rare-variant load varies substantially across biological pathways, and that each individual contains hundreds of rare non-coding variants at conserved sites, such as motif-disrupting changes in transcription-factor-binding sites.

In this study, we aimed to analyze the expression levels of Ki67 (MKI67) messenger RNA (mRNA) derived from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues for comparison with the immunohistochemical Ki67 labeling index, and investigate the correlation coefficients with clinical outcomes.
METHODS: We analyzed the data of Ki67 mRNA from FFPE and matched fresh-frozen (FF) tissues based on a real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay system in 203 cases of primary invasive breast cancer.
RESULTS: The correlation between Ki67 mRNA expression of either FFPE or FF specimens and Ki67 labeling index was positive, as was the correlation between the FFPE and FF results (P {\textless} 0.0001). Ki67 mRNA expression of FFPE specimens was significantly associated with clinicopathological characteristics: tumor size, lymph node status, nuclear grade, hormone receptors, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2) status, and tumor subtype. In prognostic results, Ki67 gene expression in the FFPE specimens revealed almost similar patterns of significance in Kaplan-Meier curves and univariate and multivariate relapse-free survival results as the Ki67 labeling index.
CONCLUSIONS: Gene expression analysis of Ki67 of FFPE specimens could be successfully performed using RT-qPCR, closely resembling the significant clinical characteristics of Ki67 labeling index. These results confirm that Ki67 gene expression of FFPE specimens has potential for evaluation of cell cycle activity of breast cancer specimens.},

Deciphering whether actionable driver mutations are found in all or a subset of tumor cells will likely be required to improve drug development and precision medicine strategies. We analyzed nine cancer types to determine the subclonal frequencies of driver events, to time mutational processes during cancer evolution, and to identify drivers of subclonal expansions. Although mutations in known driver genes typically occurred early in cancer evolution, we also identified later subclonal “actionable” mutations, including BRAF (V600E), IDH1 (R132H), PIK3CA (E545K), EGFR (L858R), and KRAS (G12D), which may compromise the efficacy of targeted therapy approaches. More than 20\% of IDH1 mutations in glioblastomas, and 15\% of mutations in genes in the PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)–AKT–mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling axis across all tumor types were subclonal. Mutations in the RAS–MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase) signaling axis were less likely to be subclonal than mutations in genes associated with PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling. Analysis of late mutations revealed a link between APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis and the acquisition of subclonal driver mutations and uncovered putative cancer genes involved in subclonal expansions, including CTNNA2 and ATXN1. Our results provide a pan-cancer census of driver events within the context of intratumor heterogeneity and reveal patterns of tumor evolution across cancers. The frequent presence of subclonal driver mutations suggests the need to stratify targeted therapy response according to the proportion of tumor cells in which the driver is identified.},

We present a novel probabilistic model, TITAN, to infer CNA and LOH events while accounting for mixtures of cell populations, thereby estimating the proportion of cells harboring each event. We evaluate TITAN on idealized mixtures, simulating clonal populations from whole-genome sequences taken from genomically heterogeneous ovarian tumor sites collected from the same patient. In addition, we show in 23 whole genomes of breast tumors that the inference of CNA and LOH using TITAN critically informs population structure and the nature of the evolving cancer genome. Finally, we experimentally validated subclonal predictions using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and single-cell sequencing from an ovarian cancer patient sample, thereby recapitulating the key modeling assumptions of TITAN.},

This algorithm builds on our earlier Tumor Heterogeneity Analysis (THetA) algorithm in several important directions. These include improved ability to analyze highly rearranged genomes using a variety of data types: both WGS sequencing (including low ∼7× coverage) and WXS sequencing. We apply our improved THetA2 algorithm to WGS (including low-pass) and WXS sequence data from 18 samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We find that the improved algorithm is substantially faster and identifies numerous tumor samples containing subclonal populations in the TCGA data, including in one highly rearranged sample for which other tumor purity estimation algorithms were unable to estimate tumor purity.},

We describe a computerized method to detect and classify follicular adenoma of the thyroid, follicular carcinoma of the thyroid, and normal thyroid based on the nuclear chromatin distribution from digital images of tissue obtained by routine histological methods. Our method is based on determining whether a set of nuclei, obtained from histological images using automated image segmentation, is most similar to sets of nuclei obtained from normal or diseased tissues. This comparison is performed utilizing numerical features, a support vector machine, and a simple voting strategy. We also describe novel methods to identify unique and defining chromatin patterns pertaining to each class. Unlike previous attempts in detecting and classifying these thyroid lesions using computational imaging, our results show that our method can automatically classify the data pertaining to 10 different human cases with 100\% accuracy after blind cross validation using at most 43 nuclei randomly selected from each patient. We conclude that nuclear structure alone contains enough information to automatically classify the normal thyroid, follicular carcinoma, and follicular adenoma, as long as groups of nuclei (instead of individual ones) are used. We also conclude that the distribution of nuclear size and chromatin concentration (how tightly packed it is) seem to be discriminating features between nuclei of follicular adenoma, follicular carcinoma, and normal thyroid.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), studies based on whole-genome sequencing have shown genomic diversity within leukemic clones. The aim of this study was to address clonal heterogeneity in AML based on metaphase cytogenetics.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This analysis included all patients enrolled onto two consecutive, prospective, randomized multicenter trials of the Study Alliance Leukemia. Patients were newly diagnosed with non-M3 AML and were fit for intensive chemotherapy.
RESULTS: Cytogenetic subclones were detected in 418 (15.8\%) of 2,639 patients from the whole study population and in 418 (32.8\%) of 1,274 patients with aberrant karyotypes. Among those, 252 karyotypes (60.3\%) displayed a defined number of distinct subclones, and 166 (39.7\%) were classified as composite karyotypes. Subclone formation was particularly frequent in the cytogenetically adverse group, with subclone formation in 69.0\%, 67.1\%, and 64.8\% of patients with complex aberrant, monosomal, and abnl(17p) karyotypes (P {\textless} .001 each). Two-subclone patterns typically followed a mother-daughter evolution, whereas for ≥ three subclones, a branched pattern prevailed. In non-core binding factor AML, subclone formation was associated with inferior event-free and overall survival and was confirmed as an independent predictor of poor prognosis in multivariate analysis. Subgroup analysis showed that subclone formation adds prognostic information particularly in the cytogenetic adverse-risk group. Allogeneic stem-cell transplantation improved the prognosis of patients with subclone karyotypes as shown in landmark analyses.
CONCLUSION: Cytogenetic subclones are frequent in AML and permit tracing of clonal evolution and architecture. They bear prognostic significance with clonal heterogeneity as an independent adverse prognostic marker in cytogenetically adverse-risk AML.},

We studied intratumoral heterogeneity in 149 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cases by integrating whole-exome sequence and copy number to measure the fraction of cancer cells harboring each somatic mutation. We identified driver mutations as predominantly clonal (e.g., MYD88, trisomy 12, and del(13q)) or subclonal (e.g., SF3B1 and TP53), corresponding to earlier and later events in CLL evolution. We sampled leukemia cells from 18 patients at two time points. Ten of twelve CLL cases treated with chemotherapy (but only one of six without treatment) underwent clonal evolution, predominantly involving subclones with driver mutations (e.g., SF3B1 and TP53) that expanded over time. Furthermore, presence of a subclonal driver mutation was an independent risk factor for rapid disease progression. Our study thus uncovers patterns of clonal evolution in CLL, providing insights into its stepwise transformation, and links the presence of subclones with adverse clinical outcomes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the involvement of intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity in tumor progression, treatment resistance, and metastasis is established, genetic heterogeneity is seldom examined in clinical trials or practice. Many studies of heterogeneity have had prespecified markers for tumor subpopulations, limiting their generalizability, or have involved massive efforts such as separate analysis of hundreds of individual cells, limiting their clinical use. We recently developed a general measure of intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity based on whole-exome sequencing (WES) of bulk tumor DNA, called mutant-allele tumor heterogeneity (MATH). Here, we examine data collected as part of a large, multi-institutional study to validate this measure and determine whether intra-tumor heterogeneity is itself related to mortality.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: Clinical and WES data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas in October 2013 for 305 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), from 14 institutions. Initial pathologic diagnoses were between 1992 and 2011 (median, 2008). Median time to death for 131 deceased patients was 14 mo; median follow-up of living patients was 22 mo. Tumor MATH values were calculated from WES results. Despite the multiple head and neck tumor subsites and the variety of treatments, we found in this retrospective analysis a substantial relation of high MATH values to decreased overall survival (Cox proportional hazards analysis: hazard ratio for high/low heterogeneity, 2.2; 95\% CI 1.4 to 3.3). This relation of intra-tumor heterogeneity to survival was not due to intra-tumor heterogeneity's associations with other clinical or molecular characteristics, including age, human papillomavirus status, tumor grade and TP53 mutation, and N classification. MATH improved prognostication over that provided by traditional clinical and molecular characteristics, maintained a significant relation to survival in multivariate analyses, and distinguished outcomes among patients having oral-cavity or laryngeal cancers even when standard disease staging was taken into account. Prospective studies, however, will be required before MATH can be used prognostically in clinical trials or practice. Such studies will need to examine homogeneously treated HNSCC at specific head and neck subsites, and determine the influence of cancer therapy on MATH values. Analysis of MATH and outcome in human-papillomavirus-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma is particularly needed.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge this study is the first to combine data from hundreds of patients, treated at multiple institutions, to document a relation between intra-tumor heterogeneity and overall survival in any type of cancer. We suggest applying the simply calculated MATH metric of heterogeneity to prospective studies of HNSCC and other tumor types.},

Recent studies have dramatically reshaped views of polyploid evolution, demonstrating that most polyploid species examined, both plant and animal, have formed recurrently from different populations of their progenitors. Populations of independent origin can subsequently come into contact and hybridize, generating new genotypes. Because of the frequency of polyploidy in plants, many recognized species are probably polyphyletic. Extensive and rapid genome restructuring can occur after polyploidization. Such changes can be mediated by transposons. Polyploidization could represent a period of transilience, during which genomic changes occur, potentially producing new gene complexes and facilitating rapid evolution.},

	abstract = {Cancer is an evolutionary process in which cells acquire new transformative, proliferative and metastatic capabilities. A full understanding of cancer requires learning the dynamics of the cancer evolutionary process. We present here a large-scale analysis of the dynamics of this evolutionary process within tumors, with a focus on breast cancer. We show that the cancer evolutionary process differs greatly from organismal (germline) evolution. Organismal evolution is dominated by purifying selection (that removes mutations that are harmful to fitness). In contrast, in the cancer evolutionary process the dominance of purifying selection is much reduced, allowing for a much easier detection of the signals of positive selection (adaptation). We further show that, as a group, genes that are globally expressed across human tissues show a very strong signal of positive selection within tumors. Indeed, known cancer genes are enriched for global expression patterns. Yet, positive selection is prevalent even on globally expressed genes that have not yet been associated with cancer, suggesting that globally expressed genes are enriched for yet undiscovered cancer related functions. We find that the increased positive selection on globally expressed genes within tumors is not due to their expression in the tissue relevant to the cancer. Rather, such increased adaptation is likely due to globally expressed genes being enriched in important housekeeping and essential functions. Thus, our results suggest that tumor adaptation is most often mediated through somatic changes to those genes that are important for the most basic cellular functions. Together, our analysis reveals the uniqueness of the cancer evolutionary process and the particular importance of globally expressed genes in driving cancer initiation and progression.},

RESULTS: While so-called two-part tests compare mixture distributions between groups, one-part tests treat the zero-inflated distributions as left-censored. The Left-Inflated Mixture model combines these two approaches. Both types of distributional assumptions and combinations of both are considered in a simulation study to compare power and estimation of log fold change. We discuss issues of application using an example from peptidomics. The considered tests generally perform best in scenarios satisfying their respective distributional assumptions. In the absence of distributional assumptions the two-part Wilcoxon test or the Empirical Likelihood Ratio Test is recommended. Assuming a log-normal subdistribution the Left-Inflated Mixture model provides estimates for the proportions of the two considered types of zero intensities.

Genome-wide gene expression measurements are high dimensional as these are reflecting the condition-specific interplay of thousands of cellular components. The integration of prior biological knowledge into the modeling process of systems-wide gene regulation enables the large-scale interpretation of gene expression signals in the context of known regulatory relations. We developed COGERE (http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/cogere), a method for the inference of condition-specific gene regulatory networks in human and mouse. We integrated existing knowledge of regulatory interactions from multiple sources to a comprehensive model of prior information. COGERE infers condition-specific regulation by evaluating the mutual dependency between regulator (transcription factor or miRNA) and target gene expression using prior information. This dependency is scored by the non-parametric, nonlinear correlation coefficient η(2) (eta squared) that is derived by a two-way analysis of variance. We show that COGERE significantly outperforms alternative methods in predicting condition-specific gene regulatory networks on simulated data sets. Furthermore, by inferring the cancer-specific gene regulatory network from the NCI-60 expression study, we demonstrate the utility of COGERE to promote hypothesis-driven clinical research.},

	abstract = {The invention of the Internet and the emergence of the World Wide Web revolutionized people's access to digital data stored on electronic devices. Today, we take for granted the ability to specify a search query into a browser or smartphone, and tap into millions of documents and into databases of local businesses, recommendations, and coupon offers. Similarly, we also assume we can order a computer configured just the way we want, and receive it within days, even if the computer requires assembling parts from dozens of companies scattered around the world. To provide such services, systems on the Internet must efficiently and accurately process and serve a significant amount of data. But unlike traditional data management applications, such as maintaining a corporation's payroll, the new services require the ability to share data among multiple applications and organizations, and to integrate data in a flexible and efficient fashion. This book covers the principles of data integration, a set of techniques that enable building systems geared for flexible sharing and integration of data across multiple autonomous data providers. This chapter introduces the main applications of data integration and the challenges involved in building data integration systems.

Here we introduce such algorithms in an open-source software program called Cufflinks. To test Cufflinks, we sequenced and analyzed {\textgreater}430 million paired 75-bp RNA-Seq reads from a mouse myoblast cell line over a differentiation time series. We detected 13,692 known transcripts and 3,724 previously unannotated ones, 62\% of which are supported by independent expression data or by homologous genes in other species. Over the time series, 330 genes showed complete switches in the dominant transcription start site (TSS) or splice isoform, and we observed more subtle shifts in 1,304 other genes. These results suggest that Cufflinks can illuminate the substantial regulatory flexibility and complexity in even this well-studied model of muscle development and that it can improve transcriptome-based genome annotation.},

These fragments, or ‘reads’, can be used to measure levels of gene expression and to identify novel splice variants of genes. However, current software for aligning RNA-Seq data to a genome relies on known splice junctions and cannot identify novel ones. TopHat is an efficient read-mapping algorithm designed to align reads from an RNA-Seq experiment to a reference genome without relying on known splice sites.
Results: We mapped the RNA-Seq reads from a recent mammalian RNA-Seq experiment and recovered more than 72\% of the splice junctions reported by the annotation-based software from that study, along with nearly 20 000 previously unreported junctions. The TopHat pipeline is much faster than previous systems, mapping nearly 2.2 million reads per CPU hour, which is sufficient to process an entire RNA-Seq experiment in less than a day on a standard desktop computer. We describe several challenges unique to ab initio splice site discovery from RNA-Seq reads that will require further algorithm development.

A recent screen for selective inhibitors of endothelial cell proliferation identified the oral antifungal drug itraconazole as a novel agent with potential antiangiogenic activity. In this article, we define and characterize the antiangiogenic and anticancer activities of itraconazole in relevant preclinical models of angiogenesis and lung cancer. Itraconazole consistently showed potent, specific, and dose-dependent inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation in response to both VEGF- and basic fibroblast growth factor-mediated angiogenic stimulation. In vivo, using primary xenograft models of human NSCLC, oral itraconazole showed single-agent growth-inhibitory activity associated with induction of tumor hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha expression and marked inhibition of tumor vascularity. Itraconazole significantly enhanced the antitumor efficacy of the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin in the same model systems. Taken together, these data suggest that itraconazole has potent and selective inhibitory activity against multiple key aspects of tumor-associated angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo, and strongly support clinical translation of its use. Based on these observations, we have initiated a randomized phase II study comparing the efficacy of standard cytotoxic therapy with or without daily oral itraconazole in patients with recurrent metastatic NSCLC.},

	abstract = {Because the metastatic cascade is largely governed by the ability of malignant cells to adapt and proliferate at the distant tissue site, we propose that disseminated cancers are analogous in many important ways to the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of exotic species. Although pests can be decimated through the application of chemical toxins, this strategy virtually never achieves robust control as evolution of resistant phenotypes typically permits population recovery to pretreatment levels. In general, biological strategies that introduce predators, parasitoids, or pathogens have achieved more durable control of pest populations even after emergence of resistant phenotypes. From this we propose that long term outcome from any treatment strategy for invasive pests, including cancer, is not limited by evolution of resistance, but rather by the phenotypic cost of that resistance. If a cancerous cell's adaptation to therapy is achieved by upregulating xenobiotic metabolism or a redundant signaling pathway, the required investment in resources is small, and the original malignant phenotype remains essentially intact. As a result, the cancer cells' initial high level of fitness is little changed and unconstrained proliferation will resume once resistance evolves. Robust population control is possible if resistance to therapy requires a substantial and costly phenotypic adaptation that also significantly reduces the organism's fitness in its original niche: an evolutionary double bind.},

	abstract = {Although we can treat cancers with cytotoxic chemotherapies, target them with molecules that inhibit oncogenic drivers, and induce substantial cell death with radiation, local and metastatic tumours recur, resulting in extensive morbidity and mortality. Indeed, driving a tumour to extinction is difficult. Geographically dispersed species of organisms are perhaps equally resistant to extinction, but {\textgreater}99.9\% of species that have ever existed on this planet have become extinct. By contrast, we are nowhere near that level of success in cancer therapy. The phenomena are broadly analogous—in both cases, a genetically diverse population mutates and evolves through natural selection. The goal of cancer therapy is to cause cancer cell population extinction, or at least to limit any further increase in population size, to prevent the tumour burden from overwhelming the patient. However, despite available treatments, complete responses are rare, and partial responses are limited in duration. Many patients eventually relapse with tumours that evolve from cells that survive therapy. Similarly, species are remarkably resilient to environmental change. Paleontology can show us the conditions that lead to extinction and the characteristics of species that make them resistant to extinction. These lessons could be translated to improve cancer therapy and prognosis.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Somatic homozygous deletions of chromosomal regions in cancer, while not necessarily oncogenic, may lead to therapeutic vulnerabilities specific to cancer cells compared with normal cells. A recently reported example is the loss of one of the two isoenzymes in glioblastoma cancer cells such that the use of a specific inhibitor selectively inhibited growth of the cancer cells, which had become fully dependent on the second isoenzyme. We have now made use of the unprecedented conjunction of large-scale cancer genomics profiling of tumor samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and of tumor-derived cell lines in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia, as well as the availability of integrated pathway information systems, such as Pathway Commons, to systematically search for a comprehensive set of such epistatic vulnerabilities.
RESULTS: Based on homozygous deletions affecting metabolic enzymes in 16 TCGA cancer studies and 972 cancer cell lines, we identified 4104 candidate metabolic vulnerabilities present in 1019 tumor samples and 482 cell lines. Up to 44\% of these vulnerabilities can be targeted with at least one Food and Drug Administration-approved drug. We suggest focused experiments to test these vulnerabilities and clinical trials based on personalized genomic profiles of those that pass preclinical filters. We conclude that genomic profiling will in the future provide a promising basis for network pharmacology of epistatic vulnerabilities as a promising therapeutic strategy.

Prevailing methods rely on cost-intensive whole-genome sequencing (WGS) or whole-exome sequencing (WES) approaches while the identification of genomic variants from often existing RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data remains a challenge because of the intrinsic complexity in the transcriptome. Here, we present a highly accurate approach termed SNPiR to identify SNPs in RNA-seq data. We applied SNPiR to RNA-seq data of samples for which WGS and WES data are also available and achieved high specificity and sensitivity. Of the SNPs called from the RNA-seq data, {\textgreater}98\% were also identified by WGS or WES. Over 70\% of all expressed coding variants were identified from RNA-seq, and comparable numbers of exonic variants were identified in RNA-seq and WES. Despite our method’s limitation in detecting variants in expressed regions only, our results demonstrate that SNPiR outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches for variant detection from RNA-seq data and offers a cost-effective and reliable alternative for SNP discovery.},

	abstract = {Side effect similarities of drugs have recently been employed to predict new drug targets, and networks of side effects and targets have been used to better understand the mechanism of action of drugs. Here, we report a large-scale analysis to systematically predict and characterize proteins that cause drug side effects. We integrated phenotypic data obtained during clinical trials with known drug-target relations to identify overrepresented protein-side effect combinations. Using independent data, we confirm that most of these overrepresentations point to proteins which, when perturbed, cause side effects. Of 1428 side effects studied, 732 were predicted to be predominantly caused by individual proteins, at least 137 of them backed by existing pharmacological or phenotypic data. We prove this concept in vivo by confirming our prediction that activation of the serotonin 7 receptor (HTR7) is responsible for hyperesthesia in mice, which, in turn, can be prevented by a drug that selectively inhibits HTR7. Taken together, we show that a large fraction of complex drug side effects are mediated by individual proteins and create a reference for such relations.},

Over 70\% of these modules were common for multiple cell lines and 15\% were conserved between the human in vitro and the rat in vivo system. We then illustrate the utility of conserved and cell-type-specific drug-induced modules by predicting and experimentally validating (i) gene functions, e.g., 10 novel regulators of cellular cholesterol homeostasis and (ii) new mechanisms of action for existing drugs, thereby providing a starting point for drug repositioning, e.g., novel cell cycle inhibitors and new modulators of α-adrenergic receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor and estrogen receptor. Taken together, the identified modules reveal the conservation of transcriptional responses towards drugs across cell types and organisms, and improve our understanding of both the molecular basis of drug action and human biology.},

In aggregate, we found that mutated cancer genes were associated with cellular response to most currently available cancer drugs. Classic oncogene addiction paradigms were modified by additional tissue-specific or expression biomarkers, and some frequently mutated genes were associated with sensitivity to a broad range of therapeutic agents. Unexpected relationships were revealed, including the marked sensitivity of Ewing’s sarcoma cells harbouring the EWS (also known as EWSR1)-FLI1 gene translocation to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. By linking drug activity to the functional complexity of cancer genomes, systematic pharmacogenomic profiling in cancer cell lines provides a powerful biomarker discovery platform to guide rational cancer therapeutic strategies.},

Here we present and validate a 'Big Bang' model, whereby tumors grow predominantly as a single expansion producing numerous intermixed subclones that are not subject to stringent selection and where both public (clonal) and most detectable private (subclonal) alterations arise early during growth. Genomic profiling of 349 individual glands from 15 colorectal tumors showed an absence of selective sweeps, uniformly high intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) and subclone mixing in distant regions, as postulated by our model. We also verified the prediction that most detectable ITH originates from early private alterations and not from later clonal expansions, thus exposing the profile of the primordial tumor. Moreover, some tumors appear 'born to be bad', with subclone mixing indicative of early malignant potential. This new model provides a quantitative framework to interpret tumor growth dynamics and the origins of ITH, with important clinical implications.},

	abstract = {Background—Cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) is a hemorrhagic stroke disease affecting up to 0.5\% of North Americans that has no approved nonsurgical treatment. A subset of patients have a hereditary form of the disease due primarily to loss-of-function mutations in KRIT1, CCM2, or PDCD10. We sought to identify known drugs that could be repurposed to treat CCM.
Methods and Results—We developed an unbiased screening platform based on both cellular and animal models of loss of function of CCM2. Our discovery strategy consisted of 4 steps: an automated immunofluorescence and machine-learning–based primary screen of structural phenotypes in human endothelial cells deficient in CCM2, a secondary screen of functional changes in endothelial stability in these same cells, a rapid in vivo tertiary screen of dermal microvascular leak in mice lacking endothelial Ccm2, and finally a quaternary screen of CCM lesion burden in these same mice. We screened 2100 known drugs and bioactive compounds and identified 2 candidates, cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) and tempol (a scavenger of superoxide), for further study. Each drug decreased lesion burden in a mouse model of CCM vascular disease by ≈50\%.
Conclusions—By identifying known drugs as potential therapeutics for CCM, we have decreased the time, cost, and risk of bringing treatments to patients. Each drug also prompts additional exploration of biomarkers of CCM disease. We further suggest that the structure-function screening platform presented here may be adapted and scaled to facilitate drug discovery for diverse loss-of-function genetic vascular disease.},

The mechanism by which cells decide to skip mitosis to become polyploid is largely undefined. Here we used a high-content image-based screen to identify small-molecule probes that induce polyploidization of megakaryocytic leukemia cells and serve as perturbagens to help understand this process. Our study implicates five networks of kinases that regulate the switch to polyploidy. Moreover, we find that dimethylfasudil (diMF, H-1152P) selectively increased polyploidization, mature cell-surface marker expression, and apoptosis of malignant megakaryocytes. An integrated target identification approach employing proteomic and shRNA screening revealed that a major target of diMF is Aurora kinase A (AURKA). We further find that MLN8237 (Alisertib), a selective inhibitor of AURKA, induced polyploidization and expression of mature megakaryocyte markers in acute megakaryocytic leukemia (AMKL) blasts and displayed potent anti-AMKL activity in vivo. Our findings provide a rationale to support clinical trials of MLN8237 and other inducers of polyploidization and differentiation in AMKL.},

The therapeutic targeting of LSCs is challenging because LSCs are highly similar to normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and are protected by stromal cells in vivo. We screened 14,718 compounds in a leukemia-stroma co-culture system for inhibition of cobblestone formation, a cellular behavior associated with stem-cell function. Among those compounds that inhibited malignant cells but spared HSPCs was the cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin. Lovastatin showed anti-LSC activity in vitro and in an in vivo bone marrow transplantation model. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the effect was on target, via inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase.

It predicts that at a sufficiently high mutation rate, quasispecies with higher mutational robustness can displace quasispecies with higher replicative capacity, a phenomenon called "survival of the flattest". In some fitness landscapes it also predicts the existence of a maximum mutation rate, called the error threshold, beyond which the quasispecies enters into error catastrophe, losing its genetic information. The aim of this paper is to study the relationship between survival of the flattest and the transition to error catastrophe, as well as the connection between these concepts and natural selection.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs) in children carry a dismal prognosis despite the use of aggressive multi-modality treatment. Recent results have identified a somatic mutation in the H3F3A gene, resulting in replacement of lysine 27 by methionine in its encoded histone H3.3 protein (H3.3-K27M), which occurs primarily in DIPGs. The K27M mutation results in both increased and decreased gene expression. This specific mutation is an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of DIPGs. METHODS: Using cell lines and tissues from two pediatric DIPGs and one pediatric GBM tumor obtained from surgical biopsies, H3.3-K27M mutation status was determined by direct sequencing. Histone H3.3 lysine 27 (H3K27) methylation status was evaluated by western blotting with antibodies specific for mono-, di-, and trimethylated H3K27. A selective inhibitor of the H3K27 demethylase JMJD3, GSK-J4, was used to examine cell proliferation and survival. GSK-J4 was found to inhibit JMJD3-induced H3K27 demethylation, resulting in an increase of H3K27 methylation. RESULTS: The H3.3-K27M mutation was identified in the two DIPG cell lines, but not in the pediatric GBM cells, nor in other adult glioma cells. H3.3-K27M mutant DIPG cells showed rapid growth in vitro, with a doubling time of approximately 30 hrs. In contrast, a pediatric GBM cell line with wild-type H3.3 grew much more slowly, with a doubling time of 72 hrs. H3.3-K27M mutant DIPG cells showed elevated H3K27 methylation in comparison to H3.3 wild-type glioma cells. GSK-J4 induced a marked dose-dependent inhibition of growth in H3.3-K27M mutant DIPG cells while H3.3 wild-type glioma cells showed no response to GSK-J4. GSK-J4 appears to have a potent and specific effect on tumor cells with the K27M mutation. CONCLUSIONS: Altered histone H3.3 K27 methylation is associated with rapid tumor cell growth in vitro, and is associated withn increased tumor cell sensitivity to GSK-J4.

	abstract = {Background
Readers may question the interpretation of findings in clinical trials when multiple outcome measures are used without adjustment of the p-value. This question arises because of the increased risk of Type I errors (findings of false "significance") when multiple simultaneous hypotheses are tested at set p-values. The primary aim of this study was to estimate the need to make appropriate p-value adjustments in clinical trials to compensate for a possible increased risk in committing Type I errors when multiple outcome measures are used.

Discussion
The classicists believe that the chance of finding at least one test statistically significant due to chance and incorrectly declaring a difference increases as the number of comparisons increases. The rationalists have the following objections to that theory: 1) P-value adjustments are calculated based on how many tests are to be considered, and that number has been defined arbitrarily and variably; 2) P-value adjustments reduce the chance of making type I errors, but they increase the chance of making type II errors or needing to increase the sample size.

Summary
Readers should balance a study's statistical significance with the magnitude of effect, the quality of the study and with findings from other studies. Researchers facing multiple outcome measures might want to either select a primary outcome measure or use a global assessment measure, rather than adjusting the p-value.},

	abstract = {Recent scientific studies have advanced the notion of chronic inflammation as a major risk factor underlying aging and age-related diseases. In this review, low-grade, unresolved, molecular inflammation is described as an underlying mechanism of aging and age-related diseases, which may serve as a bridge between normal aging and age-related pathological processes. Accumulated data strongly suggest that continuous (chronic) upregulation of pro-inflammatory mediators (e.g., TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, COX-2, iNOS) are induced during the aging process due to an age-related redox imbalance that activates many pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, including the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. These pro-inflammatory molecular events are discussed in relation to their role as basic mechanisms underlying aging and age-related diseases. Further, the anti-inflammatory actions of aging-retarding caloric restriction and exercise are reviewed. Thus, the purpose of this review is to describe the molecular roles of age-related physiological functional declines and the accompanying chronic diseases associated with aging. This new view on the role of molecular inflammation as a mechanism of aging and age-related pathogenesis can provide insights into potential interventions that may affect the aging process and reduce age-related diseases, thereby promoting healthy longevity.},

Lung squamous, head and neck, and a subset of bladder cancers coalesced into one subtype typified by TP53 alterations, TP63 amplifications, and high expression of immune and proliferation pathway genes. Of note, bladder cancers split into three pan-cancer subtypes. The multiplatform classification, while correlated with tissue-of-origin, provides independent information for predicting clinical outcomes.

We developed a permutation-based framework to address this challenge, employing mutation data from intronic sequences to control for passenger mutational load on a per gene basis. Analysis of large-scale melanoma exome data by this approach discovered six novel melanoma genes (PPP6C, RAC1, SNX31, TACC1, STK19, and ARID2), three of which-RAC1, PPP6C, and STK19-harbored recurrent and potentially targetable mutations. Integration with chromosomal copy number data contextualized the landscape of driver mutations, providing oncogenic insights in BRAF- and NRAS-driven melanoma as well as those without known NRAS/BRAF mutations. The landscape also clarified a mutational basis for RB and p53 pathway deregulation in this malignancy. Finally, the spectrum of driver mutations provided unequivocal genomic evidence for a direct mutagenic role of UV light in melanoma pathogenesis.},

The catalogue of somatic mutations from a cancer genome bears the signatures of the mutational processes that have been operative. Here we analysed 4,938,362 mutations from 7,042 cancers and extracted more than 20 distinct mutational signatures. Some are present in many cancer types, notably a signature attributed to the APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases, whereas others are confined to a single cancer class. Certain signatures are associated with age of the patient at cancer diagnosis, known mutagenic exposures or defects in DNA maintenance, but many are of cryptic origin. In addition to these genome-wide mutational signatures, hypermutation localized to small genomic regions, ‘kataegis’, is found in many cancer types. The results reveal the diversity of mutational processes underlying the development of cancer, with potential implications for understanding of cancer aetiology, prevention and therapy.},

Despite its high clinical relevance, our knowledge of how cancer cell populations change during metastatic progression is limited. Here, we investigated intratumor genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity during metastatic progression of breast cancer. We analyzed cellular genotypes and phenotypes at the single cell level by performing immunoFISH in intact tissue sections of distant metastatic tumors from rapid autopsy cases and from primary tumors and matched lymph node metastases collected before systemic therapy. We calculated the Shannon index of intratumor diversity in all cancer cells and within phenotypically distinct cell populations. We found that the extent of intratumor genetic diversity was similar regardless of the chromosomal region analyzed, implying that it may reflect an inherent property of the tumors. We observed that genetic diversity was highest in distant metastases and was generally concordant across lesions within the same patient, whereas treatment-naïve primary tumors and matched lymph node metastases were frequently genetically more divergent. In contrast, cellular phenotypes were more discordant between distant metastases than primary tumors and matched lymph node metastases. Diversity for 8q24 was consistently higher in HER2(+) tumors compared with other subtypes and in metastases of triple-negative tumors relative to primary sites. We conclude that our integrative method that couples ecologic models with experimental data in human tissue samples could be used for the improved prognostication of patients with cancer and for the design of more effective therapies for progressive disease.},

Molecular profiling for somatic mutations that predict absence of response to anti-EGFR therapy has become standard practice in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer; however, the quantity and type of tissue available for testing is frequently limited. Further, the degree to which the primary tumor is a faithful representation of metastatic disease has been questioned. As next-generation sequencing technology becomes more widely available for clinical use and additional molecularly targeted agents are considered as treatment options in colorectal cancer, it is important to characterize the extent of tumor heterogeneity between primary and metastatic tumors.ResultsWe performed deep coverage, targeted next-generation sequencing of 230 key cancer-associated genes for 69 matched primary and metastatic tumors and normal tissue. Mutation profiles were 100\% concordant for KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF, and were highly concordant for recurrent alterations in colorectal cancer. Additionally, whole genome sequencing of four patient trios did not reveal any additional site-specific targetable alterations.ConclusionsColorectal cancer primary tumors and metastases exhibit high genomic concordance. As current clinical practices in colorectal cancer revolve around KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF mutation status, diagnostic sequencing of either primary or metastatic tissue as available is acceptable for most patients.

We confirmed this finding by applying the expression signature to data on 279 primary solid tumors of diverse types. We found that solid tumors carrying the gene-expression signature were most likely to be associated with metastasis and poor clinical outcome (P {\textless} 0.03). These results suggest that the metastatic potential of human tumors is encoded in the bulk of a primary tumor, thus challenging the notion that metastases arise from rare cells within a primary tumor that have the ability to metastasize.},

The mechanisms of resistance to 'classical' cytotoxic chemotherapeutics and to therapies that are designed to be selective for specific molecular targets share many features, such as alterations in the drug target, activation of prosurvival pathways and ineffective induction of cell death. With the increasing arsenal of anticancer agents, improving preclinical models and the advent of powerful high-throughput screening techniques, there are now unprecedented opportunities to understand and overcome drug resistance through the clinical assessment of rational therapeutic drug combinations and the use of predictive biomarkers to enable patient stratification.},

Such efforts should be greatly aided by robust preclinical model systems that reflect the genomic diversity of human cancers and for which detailed genetic and pharmacological annotation is available. Here we describe the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE): a compilation of gene expression, chromosomal copy number and massively parallel sequencing data from 947 human cancer cell lines. When coupled with pharmacological profiles for 24 anticancer drugs across 479 of the cell lines, this collection allowed identification of genetic, lineage, and gene-expression-based predictors of drug sensitivity. In addition to known predictors, we found that plasma cell lineage correlated with sensitivity to IGF1 receptor inhibitors; AHR expression was associated with MEK inhibitor efficacy in NRAS-mutant lines; and SLFN11 expression predicted sensitivity to topoisomerase inhibitors. Together, our results indicate that large, annotated cell-line collections may help to enable preclinical stratification schemata for anticancer agents. The generation of genetic predictions of drug response in the preclinical setting and their incorporation into cancer clinical trial design could speed the emergence of /`personalized/' therapeutic regimens.},

	abstract = {During the early stages of human papillomavirus (HPV) infections, the innate immune system creates a pro-inflammatory microenvironment by recruiting innate immune cells to eliminate the infected cells, initiating an effective acquired immune response. However, HPV exhibits a wide range of strategies for evading immune-surveillance, generating an anti-inflammatory microenvironment. The administration of new adjuvants, such as TLR (Toll-like receptors) agonists and alpha-galactosylceramide, has been demonstrated to reverse the anti-inflammatory microenvironment by down-regulating a number of adhesion molecules and chemo-attractants and activating keratinocytes, dendritic (DC), Langerhans (LC), natural killer (NK) or natural killer T (NKT) cells; thus, promoting a strong specific cytotoxic T cell response. Therefore, these adjuvants show promise for the treatment of HPV generated lesions and may be useful to elucidate the unknown roles of immune cells in the natural history of HPV infection. This review focuses on HPV immune evasion mechanisms and on the proposed response of the innate immune system, suggesting a role for the surrounding pro-inflammatory microenvironment and the NK and NKT cells in the clearance of HPV infections.},

As well as detecting the known bladder cancer driver mutations, we report the identification of recurrent protein-inactivating mutations in CDKN1A and FAT1. The former are not mutually exclusive with TP53 mutations or MDM2 amplification, showing that CDKN1A dysfunction is not simply an alternative mechanism for p53 pathway inactivation. We find strong positive associations between higher tumour stage/grade and greater clonal diversity, the number of somatic mutations and the burden of copy number changes. In principle, the identification of sub-clones with greater diversity and/or mutation burden within early-stage or low-grade tumours could identify lesions with a high risk of invasive progression.},

In this perspective, we advocate for the hypothesis that tumor cells with significantly elevated genomic content (polyploid tumor cells) facilitate rapid tumor evolution and the acquisition of therapy resistance in multiple incurable cancers. We appeal to studies conducted in yeast, cancer models, and cancer patients, which all converge on the hypothesis that polyploidy enables large phenotypic leaps, providing access to many different therapy-resistant phenotypes. We develop a flow-cytometry based method for quantifying the prevalence of polyploid tumor cells, and show the frequency of these cells in patient tumors may be higher than is generally appreciated. We then present recent studies identifying promising new therapeutic strategies that could be used to specifically target polyploid tumor cells in cancer patients. We argue that these therapeutic approaches should be incorporated into new treatment strategies aimed at blocking tumor evolution by killing the highly evolvable, therapy-resistant polyploid cell subpopulations, thus helping to maintain patient tumors in a drug sensitive state.},

The ongoing discovery of new risk markers by scientists presents opportunities and challenges for statisticians and clinicians to evaluate these biomarkers and to develop new risk formulations that incorporate them. One of the key questions is how best to assess and quantify the improvement in risk prediction offered by these new models. Demonstration of a statistically significant association of a new biomarker with cardiovascular risk is not enough. Some researchers have advanced that the improvement in the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) should be the main criterion, whereas others argue that better measures of performance of prediction models are needed. In this paper, we address this question by introducing two new measures, one based on integrated sensitivity and specificity and the other on reclassification tables. These new measures offer incremental information over the AUC. We discuss the properties of these new measures and contrast them with the AUC. We also develop simple asymptotic tests of significance. We illustrate the use of these measures with an example from the Framingham Heart Study. We propose that scientists consider these types of measures in addition to the AUC when assessing the performance of newer biomarkers.},

These models can use a mixture of categorical and continuous variables and can handle partially observed (censored) responses.

One must know how to measure qualities of a model's fit in order to avoid poorly fitted or overfitted models. Measurement of predictive accuracy can be difficult for survival time data in the presence of censoring. We discuss an easily interpretable index of predictive discrimination as well as methods for assessing calibration of predicted survival probabilities. Both types of predictive accuracy should be unbiasedly validated using bootstrapping or cross-validation, before using predictions in a new data series. We discuss some of the hazards of poorly fitted and overfitted regression models and present one modelling strategy that avoids many of the problems discussed. The methods described are applicable to all regression models, but are particularly needed for binary, ordinal, and time-to-event outcomes.

We present a multiscale mathematical model of cancer invasion, which considers cellular and microenvironmental factors simultaneously and interactively. Unexpectedly, the model simulations predict that harsh tumor microenvironment conditions (e.g., hypoxia, heterogenous extracellular matrix) exert a dramatic selective force on the tumor, which grows as an invasive mass with fingering margins, dominated by a few clones with aggressive traits. In contrast, mild microenvironment conditions (e.g., normoxia, homogeneous matrix) allow clones with similar aggressive traits to coexist with less aggressive phenotypes in a heterogeneous tumor mass with smooth, noninvasive margins. Thus, the genetic make-up of a cancer cell may realize its invasive potential through a clonal evolution process driven by definable microenvironmental selective forces.

	doi = {10.1002/14651858.CD003545.pub2},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Trifluoperazine is an inexpensive accessible 'high potency' antipsychotic drug, widely used to treat schizophrenia or related psychoses.
OBJECTIVES: To estimate the effects of trifluoperazine compared with placebo and other drugs.
SEARCH STRATEGY: Searches of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's register of trials (March 2002), supplemented with hand searching, reference searching, personal communication and contact with industry.
SELECTION CRITERIA: All clinical randomised trials involving people with schizophrenia and comparing trifluoperazine with any other treatment.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Studies were reliably selected and quality rated and data was extracted. For dichotomous data, relative risks (RR) were estimated, with 95\% confidence intervals (CI). Where possible, we undertook intention-to-treat analyses. For statistically significant results, the number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated. We estimated heterogeneity (I-square technique) and publication bias.
MAIN RESULTS: 1162 people from 13 studies were randomised to trifluoperazine or placebo. For global improvement, small short-term studies favoured trifluoperazine (n=95, 3 RCTs, RR 0.62 CI 0.49 to 0.78 NNT 3 CI 2 to 4). Loss to follow up was about 12\% in both groups (n=280, 7 RCTs, RR 0.99 CI 0.62 to 1.57) and more people allocated trifluoperazine used antiparkinson drugs to alleviate movements disorders compared with placebo (n=195, 4 RCTs, RR 5.06 CI 2.49 to 10.27, NNH 4 CI 2 to 9). 2230 people from 49 studies were randomised to trifluoperazine or another older generation antipsychotic. Trifluoperazine was not clearly different in terms of 'no substantial improvement' (n=1016, 27 RCTs, RR 1.06 CI 0.98 to 1.14) or leaving the study early (n=930, 22 RCTs, RR 1.15 CI 0.83 to 1.58). Almost identical numbers of people reported at least one adverse event (60\%) in each group (n=585, 14 RCTs, RR 0.99 CI 0.87 to 1.13), although trifluoperazine was more likely to cause extrapyramidal adverse effects overall when compared to low potency antipsychotics such as chlorpromazine (n=130, 3 RCTs, RR 1.66 CI 1.03 to 2.67, NNH 6 CI 3 to 121). One small study (n=38) found no clear differences between trifluoperazine and the atypical drug, sulpiride.
REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Although there are shortcomings and gaps in the data, there appears to be enough consistency over different outcomes and periods to confirm that trifluoperazine is an antipsychotic of similar efficacy to other commonly used neuroleptics for people with schizophrenia. Its adverse events profile is similar to that of other drugs. It has been claimed that trifluoperazine is effective at low doses for patients with schizophrenia but this does not appear to be based on good quality trial based evidence.},

After transfection in some nonmetastatic cell lines Mtsl can induce a metastatic phenotype. Mts1 protein can interact with non-muscle myosin, indicating that Mts1 plays a role in cell motility. In order to understand the function of this gene, we studied the expression of the mts1 mRNA and protein in vivo during mouse development. Both mRNA and protein were present in high concentrations from 12.5 to 18.5 days post coitum (dpc) in a variety of developing embryonic tissue of mesodermal origin. We found by double immunostaining with a macrophage-specific antibody that Mts1 protein was highly expressed in fetal macrophages throughout the embryonic mesenchyme and in macrophages colonizing developing lymphatic and non-lymphatic organs. Moreover, we found mts1 expression during differentiation and morphogenesis of mesenchymal tissues such as the mesenchyme surrounding the tips of digits, the mesenchyme underlying the epithelium of the bladder, and the mesenchyme between the primordia of the nasal capsule and the skin as well as in the developing dermal papilla of hair and tooth follicle. In developing bone, Mts1 was expressed in invasive mesenchymal cells and in osteoclasts. The results presented here suggest that Mtsl plays an important role in mouse development during differentiation and function of macrophages and might be involved in different processes associated with mesenchymal morphogenesis including mesenchymal-epithelial interaction, tissue remodeling, and invasion.},

Twenty members have been identified so far, and altogether, S100 proteins represent the largest subgroup in the EF-hand Ca2+ -binding protein family. A unique feature of these proteins is that individual members are localized in specific cellular compartments from which some are able to relocate upon Ca2+ activation, transducing the Ca2+ signal in a temporal and spacial manner by interacting with different targets specific for each S100 protein. Some members are even secreted from cells exerting extracellular, cytokine-like activities partially via the surface receptor RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation endproducts) with paracrine effects e.g. on neurons, promoting their survival during development or after injury. Another important aspect is that 14 bona fide S100 genes are found in a gene cluster on human chromosome 1q21 where a number of chromosomal abnormalities occur. This results in a deregulated expression of some S100 genes associated with neoplasias. Recently, S100 proteins have received increasing attention due to their close association with several human diseases including cardiomyopathy, neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. They have also been proven to be valuable in the diagnostic of these diseases, as predictive markers of improving clinical management, outcome and survival of patients and are considered having a potential as drug targets to improve therapies.},

The mice were viable and did not display developmental abnormalities in the postnatal period. However, an abnormal sex ratio was observed in the litters with the S100A4-/- genotype, raising the possibility of a certain level of embryonic lethality in this strain. In all, 10\% of 10–14-month-old S100A4-null animals developed tumors. This is a characteristic feature of mouse strains with inactivated tumor suppressor genes. Spontaneous tumors of S100A4-/- mice were p53 positive. Recently, we have shown that S100A4 interacts with p53 tumor suppressor protein and induces apoptosis. We proposed that impairment of this interaction could affect the apoptosis-promoting function of p53 that is involved in its tumor suppressor activity. The frequency of apoptosis in the spleen of S100A4-/- animals after whole-body -irradiation was reduced compared to the wild-type animals. The same was true for the transcriptional activation of the p53 target genes – waf/p21/cip1 and bax. Taken together, these observations indicate that spontaneous tumors in S100A4-/- mice are a result of functional destabilization of p53 tumor suppressor gene.},

However, the predictive utility of this marker has not been rigorously tested with regard to sensitivity to other therapies, namely radiation. To address this issue, we assessed MGMT methylation status in a cohort of patients with GBM who underwent radiation treatment but did not receive chemotherapy as a component of adjuvant treatment. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples from 225 patients with newly diagnosed GBM were analyzed via methylation-specific, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction following bisulfite treatment on isolated DNA to assess MGMT promoter methylation status. In patients who received radiotherapy alone following resection, methylation of the MGMT promoter correlated with an improved response to radiotherapy. Unmethylated tumors were twice as likely to progress during radiation treatment. The median time interval between resection and tumor progression of unmethylated tumors was also nearly half that of methylated tumors. Promoter methylation was also found to confer improved overall survival in patients who did not receive adjuvant alkylating chemotherapy. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that methylation status was independent of age, Karnofsky performance score, and extent of resection as a predictor of time to progression and overall survival. Our data suggest that MGMT promoter methylation appears to be a predictive biomarker of radiation response. Since this biomarker has also been shown to predict response to alkylating agents, perhaps MGMT promoter methylation represents a general, favorable prognostic factor in GBM.},

	abstract = {Few ideas have gained such strong acceptance in the scientific community as the monoclonal origin of tumors; the idea that tumors start with a single mutated cell (or a single clone of cells) that go on to accumulate additional mutations as a tumor develops. The certainty with which this concept is held by the scientific community reflects the length of time it has been unchallenged and the experimental difficulty in obtaining direct evidence to the contrary. Yet, recent findings regarding X chromosome inactivation patch size indicate that the X-linked marker data previously interpreted as evidence of monoclonal tumor origin is actually more consistent with polyclonal tumor origin, a situation where two or more cells or clones of cells interact to initiate a tumor. Although most tumors show homotypy for X-linked markers (as expected given the bias conferred by X chromosome inactivation patch size), the literature contains numerous examples of tumors with X-linked marker heterotypy, examples of which encompass 24 different tumor types. Chimeric models have yielded direct unequivocal demonstrations of polyclonality in rodent and human tumors. Also, mutational data are consistent with polyclonal tumor origin. Methods that analyze levels of tumor-associated oncogene and tumor suppressor gene mutations demonstrate that initiated cells are much more common in normal tissues than previously realized. Also, while tumors have higher levels of mutation than normal tissues, oncogenic mutations frequently are present as subpopulations within tumors, rather than as the pure mutant populations expected to develop from a single initiated cell. Understanding the mutational basis of tumor etiology has important practical significance for assessing cancer risk, as well as in modeling and treating cancer. Therefore, the scientific community needs to re-examine this issue and consider the implications of polyclonal origin for, perhaps, a majority of tumors, encompassing many different tumor types.},

	issn = {0098-2997},
	abstract = {The process by which normal cells become progressively transformed to malignancy is now known to require the sequential acquisition of mutations which arise as a consequence of damage to the genome. This damage can be the result of endogenous processes such as errors in replication of DNA, the intrinsic chemical instability of certain DNA bases or from attack by free radicals generated during metabolism. DNA damage can also result from interactions with exogenous agents such as ionizing radiation, UV radiation and chemical carcinogens. Cells have evolved means to repair such damage, but for various reasons errors occur and permanent changes in the genome, mutations, are introduced. Some inactivating mutations occur in genes responsible for maintaining genomic integrity facilitating the acquisition of additional mutations. This review seeks first to identify sources of mutational damage so as to identify the basic causes of human cancer. Through an understanding of cause, prevention may be possible. The evolution of the normal cell to a malignant one involves processes by which genes involved in normal homeostatic mechanisms that control proliferation and cell death suffer mutational damage which results in the activation of genes stimulating proliferation or protection against cell death, the oncogenes, and the inactivation of genes which would normally inhibit proliferation, the tumor suppressor genes. Finally, having overcome normal controls on cell birth and cell death, an aspiring cancer cell faces two new challenges: it must overcome replicative senescence and become immortal and it must obtain adequate supplies of nutrients and oxygen to maintain this high rate of proliferation. This review examines the process of the sequential acquisition of mutations from the prospective of Darwinian evolution. Here, the fittest cell is one that survives to form a new population of genetically distinct cells, the tumor. This review does not attempt to be comprehensive but identifies key genes directly involved in carcinogenesis and demonstrates how mutations in these genes allow cells to circumvent cellular controls. This detailed understanding of the process of carcinogenesis at the molecular level has only been possible because of the advent of modern molecular biology. This new discipline, by precisely identifying the molecular basis of the differences between normal and malignant cells, has created novel opportunities and provided the means to specifically target these modified genes. Whenever possible this review highlights these opportunities and the attempts being made to generate novel, molecular based therapies against cancer. Successful use of these new therapies will rely upon a detailed knowledge of the genetic defects in individual tumors. The review concludes with a discussion of how the use of high throughput molecular arrays will allow the molecular pathologist/therapist to identify these defects and direct specific therapies to specific mutations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chromosomal instability (CIN) is thought to be associated with poor prognosis in solid tumors; however, evidence from preclinical and mouse tumor models suggest that CIN may paradoxically enhance or impair cancer cell fitness. Breast cancer prognostic expression signature sets, which reflect tumor CIN status, efficiently delineate outcome in estrogen receptor ER-positive breast cancer in contrast to ER-negative breast cancer, suggesting that the relationship of CIN with prognosis differs in these two breast cancer subtypes.
METHODS: Direct assessment of CIN requires single-cell analysis methods, such as centromeric FISH, aimed at determining the variation around the modal number of two or more chromosomes within individual tumor nuclei. Here, we document the frequency of tumor CIN by dual centromeric FISH analysis in a retrospective primary breast cancer cohort of 246 patients with survival outcome.
RESULTS: There was increased CIN and clonal heterogeneity in ER-negative compared with ER-positive breast cancer. Consistent with a negative impact of CIN on cellular fitness, extreme CIN in ER-negative breast cancer was an independent variable associated with improved long-term survival in multivariate analysis. In contrast, a linear relationship of increasing CIN with poorer prognosis in ER-positive breast cancer was observed, using three independent measures of CIN.
CONCLUSIONS: The paradoxical relationship between extreme CIN and cancer outcome in the ER-negative cohorts may explain why prognostic expression signatures, reflecting tumor CIN status, fail to predict outcome in this subgroup.
IMPACT: Assessment of tumor CIN status may support risk stratification in ER-negative breast cancer and requires prospective validation.},

	abstract = {AIM: The neutrophil: lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a prognostic marker in several malignancies. This study assessed whether it can be used as a predictor of loco-regional recurrence after chemoradiotherapy for anal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).
METHOD: Patients treated with curative intent between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2011 were identified. Pretreatment blood tests and radiological staging were available from multidisciplinary meeting records. The NLR was calculated from pretreatment blood tests. The relationship between the NLR and clinicopathological parameters was analysed. Modified receiver-operating characteristics curves were constructed to determine the cut-off NLR to dichotomise the data for survival analyses. The measured cut-off was 4.75.
RESULTS: Ninety-two patients were identified. Pretreatment T-stages were T1 (n = 7), T2 (n = 36), T3 (n = 35) and T4 (n = 14) and pretreatment N stages were N0 (n = 62) and N+ disease (n = 30). The NLR was significantly higher in N+ disease (P = 0.014) and in patients who developed recurrence (P = 0.003). On multivariate analysis, the NLR maintained its significance, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.38 (95\% CI = 1.195-1.594) (P {\textless} 0.0001). An elevated NLR was associated with worse overall (P {\textless} 0.0001) and cancer-specific (P {\textless} 0.0001) survival. Multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that an elevated NLR was prognostic for overall survival (HR = 6.381, 95\% CI = 1.742-23.372, P = 0.005) and for cancer-specific survival (HR = 10.613, 95\% CI = 1.968-57.241, P = 0.006).
CONCLUSION: Pretreatment NLR may be a simple biomarker for predicting disease recurrence and overall and cancer-specific survival after potentially curative chemo-radiotherapy for SCC of the anus.},

Here we measure the expression of 92 genes affected by Wnt signaling in 1,440 single cells from 15 individuals to associate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with gene-expression phenotypes, while accounting for stochastic and cell-cycle differences between cells. We provide evidence that many heritable variations in gene function—such as burst size, burst frequency, cell cycle–specific expression and expression correlation/noise between cells—are masked when expression is averaged over many cells. Our results demonstrate how single-cell analyses provide insights into the mechanistic and network effects of genetic variability, with improved statistical power to model these effects on gene expression.},

We illustrate the distributions of mutation frequencies, types and contexts across tumour types, and establish their links to tissues of origin, environmental/carcinogen influences, and DNA repair defects. Using the integrated data sets, we identified 127 significantly mutated genes from well-known (for example, mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase, Wnt/β-catenin and receptor tyrosine kinase signalling pathways, and cell cycle control) and emerging (for example, histone, histone modification, splicing, metabolism and proteolysis) cellular processes in cancer. The average number of mutations in these significantly mutated genes varies across tumour types; most tumours have two to six, indicating that the number of driver mutations required during oncogenesis is relatively small. Mutations in transcriptional factors/regulators show tissue specificity, whereas histone modifiers are often mutated across several cancer types. Clinical association analysis identifies genes having a significant effect on survival, and investigations of mutations with respect to clonal/subclonal architecture delineate their temporal orders during tumorigenesis.

	abstract = {Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (ATRT) is a malignant tumor of the central nervous system that most commonly arises in young children. The aggressive growth and propensity for early dissemination throughout the neuraxis confers a dismal prognosis. Large clinical trials that could test new therapeutic agents are difficult to conduct due to the low incidence of this cancer. For this reason, high throughput preclinical testing with suitable animal models for ATRT would serve a critical need for identifying the most efficacious treatments. In response to this need, we have adapted ATRT cell lines for bioluminescence imaging (BLI) of intracranial (orthotopic) xenografts established in athymic mice. Our results indicate that following supratentorial or infratentorial injection in athymic mice, ATRT cells produce rapidly growing tumors, often with intraventricular spread or neuraxis dissemination. When established as orthotopic xenografts, the tumors predominantly display cells with a rhabdoid-like cellular morphology that show a spectrum of immunophenotypes similar to primary ATRT tumors. To demonstrate the feasibility of this orthotopic ATRT xenograft model for therapeutic testing with correlation to biomarker analysis, we examined the responses of luciferase-modified ATRT cells to temozolomide (TMZ). These xenografts, which highly express MGMT, are resistant to TMZ treatment when compared with an orthotopic glioblastoma xenograft that is MGMT deficient and responsive to TMZ. These data suggest that an orthotopic ATRT xenograft model, in which BLI is used for monitoring tumor growth and response to therapy, should contribute to the identification of effective therapeutics and regimens for treating this highly aggressive pediatric brain tumor.},

	abstract = {AIMS: CD44, CD24 and ALDH1 are the most consistently used biomarkers to identify and characterise the breast cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotype. However, most studies performed until now analysed samples of invasive ductal carcinomas of no special type (IDC-NST). Therefore, prevalence and clinical significance of these CSC markers in breast carcinomas of special histological types (SHT) is largely unknown. For that reason, this study aims to determine the distribution of the breast CD44, CD24 and ALDH1 CSC markers among a series of invasive breast carcinomas of SHT, in comparison with a series of IDC-NST.
METHODS: 117 invasive SHT breast carcinomas were analysed for the expression of CD44, CD24 and ALDH1, by immuhohistochemistry. The distribution of these CSC markers was evaluated among the distinct histological special types, and the results were compared with a series of 466 IDC-NST.
RESULTS: The expression prevalence of the breast CSC markers differed between special types and IDC-NST. Medullary, papillary and tubular carcinomas were enriched in the CSC phenotype CD44(+)/CD24(-/low) (80.0\%, 100.0\% and 100.0\%, respectively, vs 45.3\% in IDC-NST). Considering the ALDH1 cytoplasmic tumour expression, only medullary and metaplastic carcinomas displayed significant increase in CD44(+)/CD24(-/low)/ALDH1(+) CSC phenotype frequency (36.4\% and 28.6\%, respectively, vs 4.8\% in IDC-NST).
CONCLUSIONS: The expression distribution of breast CSC markers is largely dependent on histological type. Interestingly, within the distinct SHT, medullary and metaplastic carcinomas are the two types highly associated with high-grade carcinomas, basal-like and claudin-low molecular subtypes, and to the CSC phenotype CD44(+)/CD24(-/low)/ALDH1(+).},

Current mechanisms for clinical prognostication and stratification include clinical factors (age, presence of metastases, and extent of resection) as well as histological subgrouping (classic, desmoplastic, and large cell/anaplastic histology). Transcriptional profiling studies of medulloblastoma cohorts from several research groups around the globe have suggested the existence of multiple distinct molecular subgroups that differ in their demographics, transcriptomes, somatic genetic events, and clinical outcomes. Variations in the number, composition, and nature of the subgroups between studies brought about a consensus conference in Boston in the fall of 2010. Discussants at the conference came to a consensus that the evidence supported the existence of four main subgroups of medulloblastoma (Wnt, Shh, Group 3, and Group 4). Participants outlined the demographic, transcriptional, genetic, and clinical differences between the four subgroups. While it is anticipated that the molecular classification of medulloblastoma will continue to evolve and diversify in the future as larger cohorts are studied at greater depth, herein we outline the current consensus nomenclature, and the differences between the medulloblastoma subgroups.},

Rhabdoid tumors (also called atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) in the brain), are highly malignant, poor prognosis lesions arising in the kidneys, soft tissues and central nervous system. Targeted therapy in this disease would benefit from advanced technologies detecting relevant actionable mutations.

Procedure
Here we report on the evaluation of twenty-five tumors, all with known SMARCB1/INI1 alterations, for the presence of 983 different mutations in 115 oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes using OncoMap, a mass spectrometric method of allele detection.

Results
Other than mutations in SMARCB1, our results identified a single activating mutation in NRAS and complete absence of oncogenic mutations in all other genes tested.

Conclusion
The absence of mutations in canonical pathways critical for development and progression of adult cancers suggests that distinct mechanisms drive these highly malignant pediatric tumors. This may limit the therapeutic utility of available targeted therapies and require a refocusing toward developmental and epigenetic pathways.},

The discovery of submicroscopic copy-number variations (CNVs) present in our genomes has changed dramatically our perspective on DNA structural variation and disease. It is now thought that CNVs encompass more total nucleotides and arise more frequently than SNPs. CNVs, to a larger extent than SNPs, have been shown to be responsible for human evolution, genetic diversity between individuals, and a rapidly increasing number of traits or susceptibility to traits; such conditions have been referred to as genomic disorders. In addition to well-known sporadic chromosomal microdeletion syndromes and Mendelian diseases, many common complex traits including autism and schizophrenia can result from CNVs. Both recombination- and replication-based mechanisms for CNV formation have been described.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity conservation addresses information challenges through estimations encapsulated in measures of diversity. A quantitative measure of phylogenetic diversity, “PD”, has been defined as the minimum total length of all the phylogenetic branches required to span a given set of taxa on the phylogenetic tree (). While a recent paper incorrectly characterizes PD as not including information about deeper phylogenetic branches, PD applications over the past decade document the proper incorporation of shared deep branches when assessing the total PD of a set of taxa. Current PD applications to macroinvertebrate taxa in streams of New South Wales, Australia illustrate the practical importance of this definition. Phylogenetic lineages, often corresponding to new, “cryptic”, taxa, are restricted to a small number of stream localities. A recent case of human impact causing loss of taxa in one locality implies a higher PD value for another locality, because it now uniquely represents a deeper branch. This molecular-based phylogenetic pattern supports the use of DNA barcoding programs for biodiversity conservation planning. Here, PD assessments side-step the contentious use of barcoding-based “species” designations. Bio-informatics challenges include combining different phylogenetic evidence, optimization problems for conservation planning, and effective integration of phylogenetic information with environmental and socio-economic data.},

Here we report that a simple PCR-based assay interrogating somatic variation in hypermutable polyguanine (poly-G) repeats can provide a rapid and reliable assessment of mitotic history and clonal architecture in human cancer. We use poly-G repeat genotyping to study the evolution of colon carcinoma. In a cohort of 22 patients, we detect poly-G variants in 91\% of tumors. Patient age is positively correlated with somatic mutation frequency, suggesting that some poly-G variants accumulate before the onset of carcinogenesis during normal division in colonic stem cells. Poorly differentiated tumors have fewer mutations than well-differentiated tumors, possibly indicating a shorter mitotic history of the founder cell in these cancers. We generate poly-G mutation profiles of spatially separated samples from primary carcinomas and matched metastases to build well-supported phylogenetic trees that illuminate individual patients’ path of metastatic progression. Our results show varying degrees of intratumor heterogeneity among patients. Finally, we show that poly-G mutations can be found in other cancers than colon carcinoma. Our approach can generate reliable maps of intratumor heterogeneity in large numbers of patients with minimal time and cost expenditure.},

The Cit(+) trait originated in one clade by a tandem duplication that captured an aerobically expressed promoter for the expression of a previously silent citrate transporter. The clades varied in their propensity to evolve this novel trait, although genotypes able to do so existed in all three clades, implying that multiple potentiating mutations arose during the population's history.

	abstract = {The fight against cancer has drawn researchers from a wide variety of disciplines, ranging from molecular biology to physics, but the perspective of an ecological theorist has been mostly overlooked. By thinking about the cells that make up a tumour as an endangered species, cancer vulnerabilities become more apparent. Studies in conservation biology and microbial experiments indicate that extinction is a complex phenomenon, which is often driven by the interaction of ecological and evolutionary processes. Recent advances in cancer research have shown that tumours, like species striving for survival, harbour intricate population dynamics, which suggests the possibility to exploit the ecology of tumours for treatment.

	abstract = {Cancer progression is driven by the accumulation of a small number of genetic alterations. However, these few driver alterations reside in a cancer genome alongside tens of thousands of additional mutations termed passengers. Passengers are widely believed to have no role in cancer, yet many passengers fall within protein-coding genes and other functional elements that can have potentially deleterious effects on cancer cells. Here we investigate the potential of moderately deleterious passengers to accumulate and alter the course of neoplastic progression. Our approach combines evolutionary simulations of cancer progression with an analysis of cancer sequencing data. From simulations, we find that passengers accumulate and largely evade natural selection during progression. Although individually weak, the collective burden of passengers alters the course of progression, leading to several oncological phenomena that are hard to explain with a traditional driver-centric view. We then tested the predictions of our model using cancer genomics data and confirmed that many passengers are likely damaging and have largely evaded negative selection. Finally, we use our model to explore cancer treatments that exploit the load of passengers by either (i) increasing the mutation rate or (ii) exacerbating their deleterious effects. Though both approaches lead to cancer regression, the latter is a more effective therapy. Our results suggest a unique framework for understanding cancer progression as a balance of driver and passenger mutations.},

We demonstrate that NSCs of subventricular zone of lateral ventricle are molecularly and functionally distinct from those of the third ventricle. Consistent with a unique origin for pediatric low-grade glioma, third ventricle, but not lateral ventricle, NSCs hyperproliferate in response to mutations characteristic of childhood glioma. Finally, we demonstrate that pediatric optic gliomas in Nf1 genetically-engineered mice arise from the third ventricle.

This article considers the problem of how to merge datasets arising from different gene-expression studies of a common organism and phenotype. Of particular interest is how to merge data from different technological platforms.
Results: The article makes two contributions to the problem. The first is a simple cross-study normalization method, which is based on linked gene/sample clustering of the given datasets. The second is the introduction and description of several general validation measures that can be used to assess and compare cross-study normalization methods. The proposed normalization method is applied to three existing breast cancer datasets, and is compared to several competing normalization methods using the proposed validation measures.

	abstract = {Cancer cells acquire cell-autonomous capacities to undergo limitless proliferation and survival through the activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. Nevertheless, the formation of a clinically relevant tumor requires support from the surrounding normal stroma, also referred to as the tumor microenvironment. Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts, leukocytes, bone marrow-derived cells, blood and lymphatic vascular endothelial cells present within the tumor microenvironment contribute to tumor progression. Recent evidence indicates that the microenvironment provides essential cues to the maintenance of cancer stem cells/cancer initiating cells and to promote the seeding of cancer cells at metastatic sites. Furthermore, inflammatory cells and immunomodulatory mediators present in the tumor microenvironment polarize host immune response toward specific phenotypes impacting tumor progression. A growing number of studies demonstrate a positive correlation between angiogenesis, carcinoma-associated fibroblasts, and inflammatory infiltrating cells and poor outcome, thereby emphasizing the clinical relevance of the tumor microenvironment to aggressive tumor progression. Thus, the dynamic and reciprocal interactions between tumor cells and cells of the tumor microenvironment orchestrate events critical to tumor evolution toward metastasis, and many cellular and molecular elements of the microenvironment are emerging as attractive targets for therapeutic strategies.},

For human common fragile sites, which are components of normal chromatin structure, are induced by replication inhibitors, and encompass much larger regions (100s-1000s of kilobases) it has been more difficult to define particular sequence elements responsible for fragility. However recent progress reviewed here in understanding the link between replication and fragility, as well as identification of proteins and conditions needed to prevent chromosome fragility, have shed some light onto the reasons for breakage at common fragile sites. In addition, the discovery of several types of natural fragile sites on yeast chromosomes and the characterization of associated deletions, duplications, and translocations, has revealed potential mechanisms for fragility and for the chromosomal rearrangements that follow. An understanding of these events will provide insight into the generation of cancer, since deletions and rearrangements at human common fragile sites and associated tumor suppressor genes are an early event in tumorigenesis.},

Analysis of the research backing each concept, along with a review of the results of our recent study investigating putative breast cancer stem cells, suggests how the cancer stem cell hypothesis and the clonal evolution model may be involved in generating breast tumor heterogeneity.

However, it does not yet systematically address heterogeneity at the single-cell level within a single individual's cancer or the dynamic nature of cancer due to genetic and epigenetic change as well as transient functional changes. We have developed a mathematical model of personalized cancer therapy incorporating genetic evolutionary dynamics and single-cell heterogeneity, and have examined simulated clinical outcomes. Analyses of an illustrative case and a virtual clinical trial of over 3 million evaluable "patients" demonstrate that augmented (and sometimes counterintuitive) nonstandard personalized medicine strategies may lead to superior patient outcomes compared with the current personalized medicine approach. Current personalized medicine matches therapy to a tumor molecular profile at diagnosis and at tumor relapse or progression, generally focusing on the average, static, and current properties of the sample. Nonstandard strategies also consider minor subclones, dynamics, and predicted future tumor states. Our methods allow systematic study and evaluation of nonstandard personalized medicine strategies. These findings may, in turn, suggest global adjustments and enhancements to translational oncology research paradigms.},

	abstract = {Medulloblastoma, the most common malignant paediatric brain tumour, arises in the cerebellum and disseminates through the cerebrospinal fluid in the leptomeningeal space to coat the brain and spinal cord. Dissemination, a marker of poor prognosis, is found in up to 40\% of children at diagnosis and in most children at the time of recurrence. Affected children therefore are treated with radiation to the entire developing brain and spinal cord, followed by high-dose chemotherapy, with the ensuing deleterious effects on the developing nervous system. The mechanisms of dissemination through the cerebrospinal fluid are poorly studied, and medulloblastoma metastases have been assumed to be biologically similar to the primary tumour. Here we show that in both mouse and human medulloblastoma, the metastases from an individual are extremely similar to each other but are divergent from the matched primary tumour. Clonal genetic events in the metastases can be demonstrated in a restricted subclone of the primary tumour, suggesting that only rare cells within the primary tumour have the ability to metastasize. Failure to account for the bicompartmental nature of metastatic medulloblastoma could be a major barrier to the development of effective targeted therapies.},

Therefore, in the present study, three po1β promoter mutants (M1, -37 C→A; M2, -114 G→A, -37 C→A; M3, -194 T→C) were generated to examine the effect of promoter mutations on polβ gene expression and sensitivity to cisplatin. We found that the M1 and M2 mutant polβ promoter constructs showed higher RLA than the wild-type polβ promoter (P {\textless} 0.01), whereas the activity of the M3 polβ promoter did not differ significantly from that of the wild-type polβ promoter (P {\textgreater} 0.05).

	abstract = {A powerful way to discover key genes with causal roles in oncogenesis is to identify genomic regions that undergo frequent alteration in human cancers. Here we present high-resolution analyses of somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs) from 3,131 cancer specimens, belonging largely to 26 histological types. We identify 158 regions of focal SCNA that are altered at significant frequency across several cancer types, of which 122 cannot be explained by the presence of a known cancer target gene located within these regions. Several gene families are enriched among these regions of focal SCNA, including the BCL2 family of apoptosis regulators and the NF-kappaBeta pathway. We show that cancer cells containing amplifications surrounding the MCL1 and BCL2L1 anti-apoptotic genes depend on the expression of these genes for survival. Finally, we demonstrate that a large majority of SCNAs identified in individual cancer types are present in several cancer types.},

We characterized SCNA patterns in 4,934 cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas Pan-Cancer data set. Whole-genome doubling, observed in 37\% of cancers, was associated with higher rates of every other type of SCNA, TP53 mutations, CCNE1 amplifications and alterations of the PPP2R complex. SCNAs that were internal to chromosomes tended to be shorter than telomere-bounded SCNAs, suggesting different mechanisms underlying their generation. Significantly recurrent focal SCNAs were observed in 140 regions, including 102 without known oncogene or tumor suppressor gene targets and 50 with significantly mutated genes. Amplified regions without known oncogenes were enriched for genes involved in epigenetic regulation. When levels of genomic disruption were accounted for, 7\% of region pairs were anticorrelated, and these regions tended to encompass genes whose proteins physically interact, suggesting related functions. These results provide insights into mechanisms of generation and functional consequences of cancer-related SCNAs.},

	abstract = {Calcimycin restricts Wnt/β-catenin–regulated S100A4 expression, leading to reduced S100A4-mediated cell migration and invasion in colon cancer cells, as well as to inhibition of metastasis formation in xenografted mice., The calcium-binding protein S100A4 is a central mediator of metastasis formation in colon cancer. S100A4 is a target gene of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which is constitutively active in the majority of colon cancers. In this study a high-throughput screen was performed to identify small-molecule compounds targeting the S100A4-promoter activity. In this screen calcimycin was identified as a transcriptional inhibitor of S100A4. In colon cancer cells calcimycin treatment reduced S100A4 mRNA and protein expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. S100A4-induced cellular processes associated with metastasis formation, such as cell migration and invasion, were inhibited by calcimycin in an S100A4-specific manner. Calcimycin reduced β-catenin mRNA and protein levels despite the expression of Δ45-mutated β-catenin. Consequently, calcimycin inhibited Wnt/β-catenin pathway activity and the expression of prominent β-catenin target genes such as S100A4, cyclin D1, c-myc, and dickkopf-1. Finally, calcimycin treatment of human colon cancer cells inhibited metastasis formation in xenografted immunodeficient mice. Our results demonstrate that targeting the expression of S100A4 with calcimycin provides a functional strategy to restrict cell motility in colon cancer cells. Therefore calcimycin may be useful for studying S100A4 biology, and these studies may serve as a lead for the development of treatments for colon cancer metastasis.},

Although a variety of methods exist for analysis of the established alternative ChIP microarray (ChIP-chip), few approaches have been described for processing ChIP-seq data. To fill this gap, we propose an analysis pipeline specifically designed to detect protein-binding positions with high accuracy. Using previously reported data sets for three transcription factors, we illustrate methods for improving tag alignment and correcting for background signals. We compare the sensitivity and spatial precision of three peak detection algorithms with published methods, demonstrating gains in spatial precision when an asymmetric distribution of tags on positive and negative strands is considered. We also analyze the relationship between the depth of sequencing and characteristics of the detected binding positions, and provide a method for estimating the sequencing depth necessary for a desired coverage of protein binding sites.},

Moreover, sequencing studies have demonstrated surprising levels of genetic diversity between individual patient tumours of the same type. Tumour heterogeneity presents a significant therapeutic challenge as diverse cell types within a tumour can respond differently to therapies, and inter-patient heterogeneity may prevent the development of general treatments for cancer. One strategy that may help overcome tumour heterogeneity is the identification of tumour sub-populations that drive specific disease pathologies for the development of therapies targeting these clinically relevant sub-populations. Here, we have identified a dye-retaining brain tumour population that displays all the hallmarks of a tumour-initiating sub-population. Using a limiting dilution transplantation assay in immunocompromised mice, label-retaining brain tumour cells display elevated tumour-initiation properties relative to the bulk population. Importantly, tumours generated from these label-retaining cells exhibit all the pathological features of the primary disease. Together, these findings confirm dye-retaining brain tumour cells exhibit tumour-initiation ability and are therefore viable targets for the development of therapeutics targeting this sub-population.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: We assessed the convenience of elective surgery for clear cell renal carcinoma with regard to overall survival in accordance with established comorbidity criteria.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective study included all patients with a histological diagnosis of clear cell renal carcinoma diagnosed between July 1, 1983 and June 1, 2006 in a population of 200,000 inhabitants. All tumors were classified in stages according to the classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer based on the 2002 UICC TNM classification. Comorbidity in each patient was assessed by the Charlson comorbidity index. Study variables were gender, age, smoking, Charlson index, Charlson index 2 or less and greater than 2, tumor stage, localized stage and locally advanced or metastatic stage. The chi-square or Fisher exact test, or ANOVA was used to analyze the groups, as applicable. Survival associated with each tumor stage and comorbidity group was evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier test. Similarly a binary logistical regression model was used to assess survival after 1, 5 and 10 years. No minimum followup was established for including a patient in the analysis. SPSS, version 12.0 for Windows software was used for statistical analysis with a probability of the null hypothesis of lower than 0.05 considered significant.
RESULTS: A total of 232 renal masses were diagnosed during the study period, of which 192 (82.7\%) were useful for the study. There were no significant differences between the genders in age (p = 0.486), stage (p = 0.659) and Charlson index (p = 0.463). Median followup was 1,416 days. Of the 192 patients 33 (17.2\%), 28 (14.6\%), 32 (16.7\%), 29 (15.1\%), 32 (16.7\%) and 38 (19.8\%) showed a Charlson index of 1 to 5 or greater, respectively. Stage was I to IV in 29 (15.1\%), 69 (35.9\%), 40 (20.8\%) and 47 cases (24.5\%), respectively. It proved impossible to determine tumor stage in 4 cases (2.1\%). There were 72 deaths (37.5\%), including 25 (34.7\%) from intercurrent disease and 45 (62.5\%) from clear cell renal carcinoma. The cause of death could not be determined in 2 cases (2.8\%). Survival analysis revealed significant differences in overall survival according to stage (p {\textless}0.001) and Charlson index (p = 0.02), between localized stages and locally advanced or metastatic stages (p {\textless}0.001) and between patients with a Charlson index of 2 or less vs greater than 2 (p {\textless}0.001), particularly in those with local stage (p {\textless}0.001) but not in those with locally advanced or metastatic stage (p {\textgreater}0.05). In the logistical regression model tumor stage and the comorbidity index were prognostic factors after 1 year (B exponential 2.4 and 1.3, respectively, p {\textless}0.05), after 5 years (B exponential 1.6 and 1.3, p {\textless}0.05) and after 10 years (B exponential 1.5 and 1.4, respectively, p {\textless}0.05). The first was of greatest importance for short-term survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with localized clear cell renal carcinoma and a comorbidity index of greater than 2 may choose observation as treatment for the condition.},

A total of 1,660,290 new cancer cases and 580,350 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States in 2013. During the most recent 5 years for which there are data (2005-2009), delay-adjusted cancer incidence rates declined slightly in men (by 0.6\% per year) and were stable in women, while cancer death rates decreased by 1.8\% per year in men and by 1.5\% per year in women. Overall, cancer death rates have declined 20\% from their peak in 1991 (215.1 per 100,000 population) to 2009 (173.1 per 100,000 population). Death rates continue to decline for all 4 major cancer sites (lung, colorectum, breast, and prostate). Over the past 10 years of data (2000-2009), the largest annual declines in death rates were for chronic myeloid leukemia (8.4\%), cancers of the stomach (3.1\%) and colorectum (3.0\%), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (3.0\%). The reduction in overall cancer death rates since 1990 in men and 1991 in women translates to the avoidance of approximately 1.18 million deaths from cancer, with 152,900 of these deaths averted in 2009 alone. Further progress can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population, with an emphasis on those groups in the lowest socioeconomic bracket and other underserved populations.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The preoperative neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was proposed as a prognostic factor for localized clear cell renal cell carcinoma. We evaluated its role in nonclear cell renal cell carcinoma.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We queried 2 prospective kidney cancer databases. Patients who underwent full resection of localized (T1-3 N0/+ M0) nonclear cell renal cell carcinoma by radical or partial nephrectomy were included in analysis. Associations of the continuously coded neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio with disease-free survival were assessed with univariable and multivariable Cox regression models. Prognostic accuracy was evaluated with the Harrell concordance index.
RESULTS: Our final cohort included 281 patients. The 5-year disease-free survival rate was 88.1\%. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was significantly associated with disease-free survival. With each 1.0 increase in the ratio the risk of recurrence increased by 15\% (HR 1.15, p=0.028). On multivariable analysis TNM group (HR 2.84, p=0.025), Fuhrman grade (HR 3.40, p{\textless}0.001) and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (HR 1.17, p=0.022) were independently associated with disease-free survival. Adding the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio improved the accuracy of a base model to predict disease-free survival from 78.8\% to 80.8\%.
CONCLUSIONS: The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is an independent prognostic factor for disease-free survival after surgery with curative intent for localized nonclear cell renal cell carcinoma. It significantly increases the accuracy of established prognostic factors. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio may provide a meaningful adjunct for patient counseling and clinical trial design.},

	abstract = {Eosinophils are often predominant inflammatory leukocytes infiltrating oral squamous carcinoma (OSC) sites. Prostaglandins are secreted by oral carcinomas and may be involved in eosinophil infiltration. The objective of this study was to determine the factors contributing to eosinophil migration and potential anti-neoplastic effects on OSC. Eosinophil degranulation was evaluated by measuring release of eosinophil peroxidase (EPO). Eosinophil chemotaxis towards OSC cells was assessed using artificial basement membrane. Eosinophil infiltration was prominent within the tissue surrounding the OSC tumor mass. We observed growth inhibition of the OSC cell line, SCC-9, during co-culture with human eosinophils, in vitro, which correlated with EPO activity that possesses growth inhibitory activity. The PGD2 synthase inhibitor, HQL-79, abrogated migration towards SCC-9. Our data suggest that OSC-derived PGD2 may play an important role via CRTH2 (the PGD2 receptor on eosinophils) in eosinophil recruitment and subsequent anti-tumor activity through the action of eosinophil cationic proteins.},

	abstract = {Tumors are being increasingly perceived as abnormal organs that, in many respects, recapitulate the outgrowth and differentiation patterns of normal tissues. In line with this idea is the observation that only a small fraction of tumor cells is capable of initiating a new tumor. Because of the features that these cells share with somatic stem cells, they have been termed cancer stem cells (CSC). Normal stem cells reside in a "stem cell niche" that maintains them in a stem-like state. Recent data suggest that CSCs also rely on a similar niche, dubbed the "CSC niche," which controls their self-renewal and differentiation. Moreover, CSCs can be generated by the microenvironment through induction of CSC features in more differentiated tumor cells. In addition to a role in CSC maintenance, the microenvironment is hypothesized to be involved in metastasis by induction of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, leading to dissemination and invasion of tumor cells. The localization of secondary tumors also seems to be orchestrated by the microenvironment, which is suggested to form a premetastatic niche. Thus, the microenvironment seems to be of crucial importance for primary tumor growth as well as metastasis formation. Combined with its role in the protection of CSCs against genotoxic insults, these data strongly put forward the niche as an important target for novel therapies.},

Using these approaches, nuclei from 'terminally differentiated' somatic cells can be induced to express genes that are typical of embryonic stem cells, which can differentiate to form all of the cell types in the body.

We recently identified frequent alterations in chromatin remodelling pathways including recurrent mutations in H3F3A and mutations in ATRX (α-thalassemia/mental-retardation-syndrome-X-linked) in pediatric and young adult glioblastoma (GBM, WHO grade IV astrocytoma). H3F3A mutations were specific to pediatric high-grade gliomas and identified in only 3.4 \% of adult GBM. Using sequencing and/or immunohistochemical analyses, we investigated ATRX alterations (mutation/loss of expression) and their association with TP53 and IDH1 or IDH2 mutations in 140 adult WHO grade II, III and IV gliomas, 17 pediatric WHO grade II and III astrocytomas and 34 pilocytic astrocytomas. In adults, ATRX aberrations were detected in 33 \% of grade II and 46 \% of grade III gliomas, as well as in 80 \% of secondary and 7 \% of primary GBMs. They were absent in the 17 grade II and III astrocytomas in children, and the 34 pilocytic astrocytomas. ATRX alterations closely overlapped with mutations in IDH1/2 (p {\textless} 0.0001) and TP53 (p {\textless} 0.0001) in samples across all WHO grades. They were prevalent in astrocytomas and oligoastrocytomas, but were absent in oligodendrogliomas (p {\textless} 0.0001). No significant association of ATRX mutation/loss of expression and alternative lengthening of telomeres was identified in our cohort. In summary, our data show that ATRX alterations are frequent in adult diffuse gliomas and are specific to astrocytic tumors carrying IDH1/2 and TP53 mutations.

	abstract = {The molecular foundations of lower-grade gliomas (LGGs)-astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, and oligoastrocytoma-remain less well characterized than those of their fully malignant counterpart, glioblastoma. Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1/2) likely represent initiating pathogenic events. However, while IDH mutations appear to dramatically alter cellular epigenomic landscapes, definitive downstream transformative mechanisms have not been characterized. It remains likely, therefore, that additional genomic abnormalities collaborate with IDH mutation to drive oncogenesis in LGG. We performed whole exome sequencing in 4 LGGs, followed by focused resequencing in an additional 28, and found a high incidence of mutations in the ATRX gene (α thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked). ATRX forms a core component of a chromatin remodeling complex active in telomere biology. Mutations in ATRX have been identified in multiple tumor types and appear to cause alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT), a presumed precursor to genomic instability. In our samples, ATRX mutation was entirely restricted to IDH-mutant tumors, closely correlated with TP53 mutation and astrocytic differentiation, and mutually exclusive with 1p/19q codeletion, the molecular hallmark of oligodendroglioma. Moreover, ATRX mutation was highly enriched in tumors of so-called early progenitor-like transcriptional subclass ({\textasciitilde}85\%), which our prior work has linked to specific cells of origin in the forebrain subventricular zone. Finally, ATRX mutation correlated with ALT, providing a mechanistic link to genomic instability. In summary, our findings both identify ATRX mutation as a defining molecular determinant for a large subset of IDH-mutant gliomas and have direct implications on pathogenic mechanisms across the wide spectrum of LGGs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The improved prognosis for patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) relative to HPV-negative HNSCC observed in retrospective analyses remains to be confirmed in a prospective clinical trial.
METHODS: We prospectively evaluated the association of tumor HPV status with therapeutic response and survival among 96 patients with stage III or IV HNSCC of the oropharynx or larynx who participated in an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) phase II trial and who received two cycles of induction chemotherapy with intravenous paclitaxel and carboplatin followed by concomitant weekly intravenous paclitaxel and standard fractionation radiation therapy. The presence or absence of HPV oncogenic types in tumors was determined by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in situ hybridization. Two-year overall and progression-free survival for HPV-positive and HPV-negative patients were estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. The relative hazard of mortality and progression for HPV-positive vs HPV-negative patients after adjustment for age, ECOG performance status, stage, and other covariables was estimated by use of a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model. All statistical tests were two-sided.
RESULTS: Genomic DNA of oncogenic HPV types 16, 33, or 35 was located within tumor cell nuclei of 40\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 30\% to 50\%) of patients with HNSCC of the oropharynx or larynx by in situ hybridization and PCR. Compared with patients with HPV-negative tumors, patients with HPV-positive tumors had higher response rates after induction chemotherapy (82\% vs 55\%, difference = 27\%, 95\% CI = 9.3\% to 44.7\%, P = .01) and after chemoradiation treatment (84\% vs 57\%, difference = 27\%, 95\% CI = 9.7\% to 44.3\%, P = .007). After a median follow-up of 39.1 months, patients with HPV-positive tumors had improved overall survival (2-year overall survival = 95\% [95\% CI = 87\% to 100\%] vs 62\% [95\% CI = 49\% to 74\%], difference = 33\%, 95\% CI = 18.6\% to 47.4\%, P = .005, log-rank test) and, after adjustment for age, tumor stage, and ECOG performance status, lower risks of progression (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.27, 95\% CI = 0.10 to 0.75), and death from any cause (HR = 0.36, 95\% CI = 0.15 to 0.85) than those with HPV-negative tumors.
CONCLUSION: For patients with HNSCC of the oropharynx, tumor HPV status is strongly associated with therapeutic response and survival.},

We identified a full spectrum of genetic lesions and analyzed gene expression and DNA methylation signatures and determined their impact on tumor behavior. Defective VHL-mediated proteolysis was a common feature of ccRCC, which was caused not only by VHL inactivation but also by new hotspot TCEB1 mutations, which abolished Elongin C–VHL binding, leading to HIF accumulation. Other newly identified pathways and components recurrently mutated in ccRCC included PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling, the KEAP1-NRF2-CUL3 apparatus, DNA methylation, p53-related pathways and mRNA processing. This integrated molecular analysis unmasked new correlations between DNA methylation, gene mutation and/or gene expression and copy number profiles, enabling the stratification of clinical risks for patients with ccRCC.},

We surveyed more than 400 tumours using different genomic platforms and identified 19 significantly mutated genes. The PI(3)K/AKT pathway was recurrently mutated, suggesting this pathway as a potential therapeutic target. Widespread DNA hypomethylation was associated with mutation of the H3K36 methyltransferase SETD2, and integrative analysis suggested that mutations involving the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex (PBRM1, ARID1A, SMARCA4) could have far-reaching effects on other pathways. Aggressive cancers demonstrated evidence of a metabolic shift, involving downregulation of genes involved in the TCA cycle, decreased AMPK and PTEN protein levels, upregulation of the pentose phosphate pathway and the glutamine transporter genes, increased acetyl-CoA carboxylase protein, and altered promoter methylation of miR-21 (also known as MIR21) and GRB10. Remodelling cellular metabolism thus constitutes a recurrent pattern in ccRCC that correlates with tumour stage and severity and offers new views on the opportunities for disease treatment.},

	abstract = {Although prostate cancer is the most common malignancy to affect men in the Western world, the molecular mechanisms underlying its development and progression remain poorly understood. Like all cancers, prostate cancer is a genetic disease that is characterized by multiple genomic alterations, including point mutations, microsatellite variations, and chromosomal alterations such as translocations, insertions, duplications, and deletions. In prostate cancer, but not other carcinomas, these chromosome alterations result in a high frequency of gene fusion events. The development and application of novel high-resolution technologies has significantly accelerated the detection of genomic alterations, revealing the complex nature and heterogeneity of the disease. The clinical heterogeneity of prostate cancer can be partly explained by this underlying genetic heterogeneity, which has been observed between patients from different geographical and ethnic populations, different individuals within these populations, different tumour foci within the same patient, and different cells within the same tumour focus. The highly heterogeneous nature of prostate cancer provides a real challenge for clinical disease management and a detailed understanding of the genetic alterations in all cells, including small subpopulations, would be highly advantageous.},

	abstract = {Human tumors are comprised of heterogeneous cell populations that display diverse molecular and phenotypic features. To examine the extent to which epigenetic differences contribute to intratumoral cellular heterogeneity, we have developed a high-throughput method, termed MAPit-patch. The method uses multiplexed amplification of targeted sequences from submicrogram quantities of genomic DNA followed by next generation bisulfite sequencing. This provides highly scalable and simultaneous mapping of chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation on single molecules at high resolution. Long sequencing reads from targeted regions maintain the structural integrity of epigenetic information and provide substantial depth of coverage, detecting for the first time minority subpopulations of epigenetic configurations formerly obscured by existing genome-wide and population-ensemble methodologies. Analyzing a cohort of 71 promoters of genes with exons commonly mutated in cancer, MAPit-patch uncovered several differentially accessible and methylated promoters that are associated with altered gene expression between neural stem cell (NSC) and glioblastoma (GBM) cell populations. In addition, considering each promoter individually, substantial epigenetic heterogeneity was observed across the sequenced molecules, indicating the presence of epigenetically distinct cellular subpopulations. At the divergent MLH1/EPM2AIP1 promoter, a locus with three well-defined, nucleosome-depleted regions (NDRs), a fraction of promoter copies with inaccessible chromatin was detected and enriched upon selection of temozolomide-tolerant GBM cells. These results illustrate the biological relevance of epigenetically distinct subpopulations that in part underlie the phenotypic heterogeneity of tumor cell populations. Furthermore, these findings show that alterations in chromatin accessibility without accompanying changes in DNA methylation may constitute a novel class of epigenetic biomarker.},

We model tumors as a discrete time branching process that starts with a single driver mutation and proceeds as each new driver mutation leads to a slightly increased rate of clonal expansion. Using the model, we observe tremendous variation in the rate of tumor development—providing an understanding of the heterogeneity in tumor sizes and development times that have been observed by epidemiologists and clinicians. Furthermore, the model provides a simple formula for the number of driver mutations as a function of the total number of mutations in the tumor. Finally, when applied to recent experimental data, the model allows us to calculate the actual selective advantage provided by typical somatic mutations in human tumors in situ. This selective advantage is surprisingly small—0.004 ± 0.0004—and has major implications for experimental cancer research.},

It is now clear that stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment play an important role in cancer development. Molecular events through which reactive stromal cells affect cancer cells can be defined so that biomarkers and therapeutic targets can be identified. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) make up the bulk of cancer stroma and affect the tumor microenvironment such that they promote cancer initiation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. In breast cancer, CAFs not only promote tumor progression but also induce therapeutic resistance. Accordingly, targeting CAFs provides a novel way to control tumors with therapeutic resistance. This review summarizes the current understandings of tumor stroma in breast cancer with a particular emphasis on the role of CAFs and the therapeutic implications of CAFs. In addition, the effects of other stromal components such as endothelial cells, macrophages, and adipocytes in breast cancer are also discussed.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: We investigated hypoxia and necrosis in high grade and invasive bladder cancer, and related this to prognosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study of 98 primary cystectomy specimens scored for necrosis, and the hypoxia associated markers carbonic anhydrase IX, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha and 2 alpha, and Bcl2/adenovirus EIB 19 kDa interacting protein 3. Tumor tissue array was used with cores taken from representative and perinecrotic tumor regions. Necrosis was scored on whole sections as absent, less than 5 mm (comedo) or more than 5 mm (gross).
RESULTS: Of the 98 cases analyzed followup data were available on 91. Median followup was 22 months (IQR 8-35). Stage was T0/1 to T4 in 18, 20, 41 and 12 cases, respectively. The prevalence of necrosis in bladder cancer was high and it increased with stage (17\%, 30\%, 70\% and 71\% at stages T0/1 to T4, respectively). Necrosis was significantly associated with stage (p = 0.0001) and nodal status (p = 0.016). Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha showed no association with stage, grade or nodal status. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha and carbonic anhydrase IX showed a significant association with necrosis, whereas hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha and Bcl2/adenovirus EIB 19 kDa interacting protein 3 did not. Stage (p {\textless}0.0001), necrosis (p {\textless}0.0001) and intense hypoxia-inducible factor 1 positivity (p = 0.048) were the only significant prognostic factors on univariate analysis. Stage (HR 3.29, 95\% CI 1.80-6.04, p {\textless}0.001) and necrosis (HR 1.92, 95\% CI 1.05-3.51, p = 0.04) were independent prognostic factors on multivariate analysis, while hypoxia-inducible factor 1 lost significance (HR 1.36, 95\% CI 0.98-1.88, p = 0.07). Node status was only reported in 45\% of cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Necrosis (the presence and amount) in high grade and invasive bladder cancer is an independent prognostic risk factor.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In stage IA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node dissection is considered the standard treatment. However, 20\% to 30\% of patients have cancer recurrences. The purpose of this study was to determine the patterns and risk factors for recurrence in patients with stage IA NSCLC.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 201 patients who had confirmed stage IA NSCLC by lobectomy and complete lymph node dissection.
RESULTS: There were 131 male patients with a mean age of 60.68±9.26 years. The median follow-up period was 41.4 months. Recurrences were reported in 16 patients. One hundred fourteen and 87 patients were T1a (≤2 cm) and T1b ({\textgreater}2 cm to ≤3 cm), respectively. The pathologic results were as follows: adenocarcinomas and bronchioloalveolar carcinomas (n=134); squamous cell carcinomas (n=57); and other diagnoses (n=10). Tumor necrosis and lymphatic invasion were significant adverse risk factors for recurrence based on univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis showed that tumor necrosis was the only significant risk factor to predict cancer recurrence (hazard ratio, 4.336; p=0.032). The 5-year overall survival was 94.8\% for necrosis-negative patients and 86.2\% for necrosis-positive patients (p=0.04). The 5-year disease-free survival was 92.1\% for necrosis-negative patients and 78.9\% for necrosis-positive patients (p=0.016).
CONCLUSIONS: Tumor necrosis was shown to be an adverse risk factor for survival and recurrence in patients with stage IA NSCLC. Thus, close observation and individualized adjuvant therapy might be helpful for patients with stage IA NSCLC with tumor necrosis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tumour necrosis is a marker of poor prognosis in some tumours but the mechanism is unclear. This study examined the prognostic value of tumour necrosis and host inflammatory responses in colorectal cancer.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study of patients undergoing potentially curative resection of colorectal cancer at a single surgical institution over a 10-year period. Patients who underwent preoperative radiotherapy were excluded. The systemic and local inflammatory responses were assessed using the modified Glasgow Prognostic Score and Klintrup-Makinen criteria respectively. Original tumour sections were retrieved and necrosis graded as absent, focal, moderate or extensive. Associations between necrosis and clinicopathological variables were examined, and multivariable survival analyses carried out.
RESULTS: A total of 343 patients were included between 1997 and 2007. Tumour necrosis was graded as absent in 32 (9·3 per cent), focal in 166 (48·4 per cent), moderate in 101 (29·4 per cent) and extensive in 44 (12·8 per cent). There were significant associations between tumour necrosis and anaemia (P = 0·022), white cell count (P = 0·006), systemic inflammatory response (P {\textless} 0·001), local inflammatory cell infiltrate (P = 0·004), tumour node metastasis (TNM) stage (P = 0·015) and Petersen Index (P = 0·003). On univariable survival analysis, tumour necrosis was associated with cancer-specific survival (P {\textless} 0·001). On multivariable survival analysis, age (hazard ratio (HR) 1·29, 95 per cent confidence interval 1·00 to 1·66), systemic inflammatory response (HR 1·74, 1·27 to 2·39), low-grade local inflammatory cell infiltrate (HR 2·65, 1·52 to 4·63), TNM stage (HR 1·55, 1·02 to 2·35) and high-risk Petersen Index (HR 3·50, 2·21 to 5·55) were associated with reduced cancer-specific survival.
CONCLUSION: The impact of tumour necrosis on colorectal cancer survival may be due to close associations with the host systemic and local inflammatory responses.},

Here, we show that TGF-beta blockade also increases neutrophil-attracting chemokines, resulting in an influx of CD11b(+)/Ly6G(+) tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) that are hypersegmented, more cytotoxic to tumor cells, and express higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Accordingly, following TGF-beta blockade, depletion of these neutrophils significantly blunts antitumor effects of treatment and reduces CD8(+) T cell activation. In contrast, in control tumors, neutrophil depletion decreases tumor growth and results in more activated CD8(+) T cells intratumorally. Together, these data suggest that TGF-beta within the tumor microenvironment induces a population of TAN with a protumor phenotype. TGF-beta blockade results in the recruitment and activation of TANs with an antitumor phenotype.},

	abstract = {Neutrophils play an established role in host defense and in killing invading microorganisms. Although neutrophils are traditionally considered in the context of their antibacterial functions, it is becoming increasingly clear that tumor-associated neutrophils (TAN) play a major role in cancer biology. Neutrophils make up a significant portion of the inflammatory cell infiltrate in many models of cancer. Like all other leukocytes, they move into tissues under the influence of specific chemokines, cytokines and cell adhesion molecules. The tumor microenvironment has been shown to be responsible for their recruitment in cancer. We have found that TAN are a distinct population of neutrophils, differing markedly in their transcriptomic profile from both naive neutrophils and the granulocytic fraction of myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Studies have demonstrated specific examples of tumor-mediated signals (such as transforming growth factor-β) that induce the formation of a pro-tumorigenic (N2) phenotype capable of supporting tumor growth and suppressing the antitumor immune response. However, there are also studies showing that TAN can also have an antitumorigenic (N1) phenotype. Herein, we explore the literature on the different mechanisms of TAN recruitment to tumors, the unique characteristics of TAN and what shapes their pro- and/or antitumor effects.},

Moreover, eosinophil infiltration in tumor tissue is considered an independent prognostic factor. Eosinophils are often recruited to tumor sites, where eosinophil granule proteins and cytokines are released upon activation, which in turn damage and kill tumor cells. In the last decade, a number of patents based on potential cancer therapy using eosinophilic cytokines have been awarded. In this article, we review the current findings on epidemiology, experimental models, clinical pathology, and molecular mechanisms involved in the response of eosinophils towards cancer.

Conversely, in adults, cancer is frequently preceded by a long period of subclinical inflammatory disease and micronecrosis that provides a setting in which the epigenetic regulation of genes, cell death, cell proliferation and mutagenesis occurs. Here, we provocatively suggest that adult cancer results from rounds of disordered and unscheduled necrotic cell death, subsequent epithelial proliferation and the resulting suppressed immunity, rather than from a process that is dictated solely by cell growth. This paradigm shift regarding the development of cancer and this 'sixth sense' of the immune system indicates new strategies for cancer prevention and therapy.},

However, heterogeneous breast tumors provide a unique opportunity to study human tumor progression because they still contain evidence of early and intermediate subpopulations in the form of the phylogenetic relationships. We have developed a method we call Sector-Ploidy-Profiling (SPP) to study the clonal composition of breast tumors. SPP involves macro-dissecting tumors, flow-sorting genomic subpopulations by DNA content, and profiling genomes using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Breast carcinomas display two classes of genomic structural variation: (1) monogenomic and (2) polygenomic. Monogenomic tumors appear to contain a single major clonal subpopulation with a highly stable chromosome structure. Polygenomic tumors contain multiple clonal tumor subpopulations, which may occupy the same sectors, or separate anatomic locations. In polygenomic tumors, we show that heterogeneity can be ascribed to a few clonal subpopulations, rather than a series of gradual intermediates. By comparing multiple subpopulations from different anatomic locations, we have inferred pathways of cancer progression and the organization of tumor growth.},

We found 32 somatic non-synonymous coding mutations present in the metastasis, and measured the frequency of these somatic mutations in DNA from the primary tumour of the same patient, which arose 9 years earlier. Five of the 32 mutations (in ABCB11, HAUS3, SLC24A4, SNX4 and PALB2) were prevalent in the DNA of the primary tumour removed at diagnosis 9 years earlier, six (in KIF1C, USP28, MYH8, MORC1, KIAA1468 and RNASEH2A) were present at lower frequencies (1-13\%), 19 were not detected in the primary tumour, and two were undetermined. The combined analysis of genome and transcriptome data revealed two new RNA-editing events that recode the amino acid sequence of SRP9 and COG3.

By stochastic simulations of CpG islands over multiple cell cycles and systematic sampling of reaction parameters, we show that the standard model is inconsistent with many experimental observations. In contrast, dynamic collaboration between CpGs can provide strong error-tolerant somatic inheritance of both hypermethylated and hypomethylated states of a cluster of CpGs, reproducing observed stable bimodal methylation patterns. Known recruitment of methylating enzymes by methylated CpGs could provide the necessary collaboration, but we predict that recruitment of demethylating enzymes by unmethylated CpGs strengthens inheritance and allows CpG islands to remain hypomethylated within a sea of hypermethylation.},

Thus, the presence and behaviors of distinct clonal populations in each patient's tumor may underlie multiple clinical phenotypes in cancers. We applied DNA content-based flow sorting to identify and isolate the nuclei of clonal populations from tumor biopsies, which was coupled with array CGH and targeted resequencing. The results produced high-definition genomic profiles of clonal populations from 40 pancreatic adenocarcinomas and a set of prostate adenocarcinomas, including serial biopsies from a patient who progressed to androgen-independent metastatic disease. The genomes of clonal populations were found to have patient-specific aberrations of clinical relevance. Furthermore, we identified genomic aberrations specific to therapeutically responsive and resistant clones arising during the evolution of androgen-independent metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma. We also distinguished divergent clonal populations within single biopsies and mapped aberrations in multiple aneuploid populations arising in primary and metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. We propose that our high-definition analyses of the genomes of distinct clonal populations of cancer cells in patients in vivo can help guide diagnoses and tailor approaches to personalized treatment.},

In this article, we present the results for 20 world regions, summarizing the global patterns for the eight most common cancers. Overall, an estimated 12.7 million new cancer cases and 7.6 million cancer deaths occur in 2008, with 56\% of new cancer cases and 63\% of the cancer deaths occurring in the less developed regions of the world. The most commonly diagnosed cancers worldwide are lung (1.61 million, 12.7\% of the total), breast (1.38 million, 10.9\%) and colorectal cancers (1.23 million, 9.7\%). The most common causes of cancer death are lung cancer (1.38 million, 18.2\% of the total), stomach cancer (738,000 deaths, 9.7\%) and liver cancer (696,000 deaths, 9.2\%). Cancer is neither rare anywhere in the world, nor mainly confined to high-resource countries. Striking differences in the patterns of cancer from region to region are observed.},

In 2001, the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium reported a draft sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome. Since then, the international collaboration has worked to convert this draft into a genome sequence with high accuracy and nearly complete coverage. Here, we report the result of this finishing process. The current genome sequence (Build 35) contains 2.85 billion nucleotides interrupted by only 341 gaps. It covers {\textasciitilde}99\% of the euchromatic genome and is accurate to an error rate of {\textasciitilde}1 event per 100,000 bases. Many of the remaining euchromatic gaps are associated with segmental duplications and will require focused work with new methods. The near-complete sequence, the first for a vertebrate, greatly improves the precision of biological analyses of the human genome including studies of gene number, birth and death. Notably, the human genome seems to encode only 20,000–25,000 protein-coding genes. The genome sequence reported here should serve as a firm foundation for biomedical research in the decades ahead.},

The prevailing paradigm in the cancer field is that cancers start from the "immortalization" or "re-programming" of a normal, differentiated cell with many mitochondria, that metabolize via oxidative phosphorylation. This paradigm has been challenged with one that assumes that the target cell for carcinogenesis is the normal, immortal adult stem cell, with few mitochondria. This adult organ-specific stem cell is blocked from "mortalizing" or from "programming" to be terminally differentiated. Two hypotheses have been offered to explain cancers, namely, the "stem cell theory" and the "de-differentiation" or "re-programming" theory. This Commentary postulates that the paleochemistry of the oceans, which, initially, provided conditions for life' s energy to arise via glycolysis, changed to oxidative phosphorylation for life' s processes. In doing so, stem cells evolved, within hypoxic niches, to protect the species germinal and somatic genomes. This Commentary provides support for the "stem cell theory", in that cancer cells, which, unlike differentiated cells, have few mitochondria and metabolize via glycolysis. The major argument against the "de-differentiation theory" is that, if re-programming of a differentiated cell to an "induced pluri-potent stem cell" happened in an adult, teratomas, rather than carcinomas, should be the result.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify whether regular aspirin use protects against esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) and if so, the effect of the duration and frequency of drug exposure.
METHODS: Studies were selected from five journal/trial databases based on defined inclusion and exclusion criteria; most notably, the provision of multivariate EA odds ratios (ORs) in those taking regular aspirin. A subgroup analysis was then performed by stratifying the results according to the frequency and duration of aspirin use. The reliability of these investigations was assessed by calculating study heterogeneity and observing any elements of publication bias.
RESULTS: Nine studies were selected for the main analysis, of which five were included in the frequency analysis and three assessed the duration of aspirin use. Data pooling revealed a statistically significant EA OR of 0.671 (95\% CI 0.526-0.856, P = 0.001) among all aspirin users, suggesting a protective effect. The results for duration and frequency did not reach statistical significance but nonetheless suggested possible benefits of longer, more frequent drug regimens that may be statistically confirmed by studies of larger sample sizes. Funnel plots and statistical tests demonstrated a minimal impact of publication bias on our results.
CONCLUSION: Aspirin use confers a significant protective effect against EA with a suggestion that the degree of protection may be increased by the longer duration and higher frequency of usage.},

In this study, we examined the ability of olopatadine to inhibit the expression of cytokine genes in vitro via high-affinity receptors for immunoglobulin E in mast cells, using a rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cell line and an in vivo mouse model. Levels of gene expression in RBL-2H3 cells were determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, and serum interleukin-4 (IL-4) level in mice was quantified by ELISA. Olopatadine inhibited significantly the induction of IL-4 expression by mast cells both in vivo and in vitro. Olopatadine inhibited Ca(2+) influx through receptor-operated channels (ROC) without affecting Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores. Comparative analysis of olopatadine with other anti-allergic drugs and the ROC blocker SKF-96365 demonstrated that the potency of inhibition of Ca(2+) influx correlated with the degree of suppression of degranulation and arachidonic acid release. Inhibition of Ca(2+) influx decreased phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase, which participate in regulation of cytokine (e.g. IL-4) gene expression. However, the rank order of inhibition of Ca(2+) influx did not correspond to reduction of IL-4 expression, suggesting that an unknown mechanism(s) of action, in addition to inhibition of Ca(2+) influx, is involved in the expression of cytokines in mast cells.},

The typical query supported by PolySearch is 'Given X, find all Y's' where X or Y can be diseases, tissues, cell compartments, gene/protein names, SNPs, mutations, drugs and metabolites. PolySearch also exploits a variety of techniques in text mining and information retrieval to identify, highlight and rank informative abstracts, paragraphs or sentences. PolySearch's performance has been assessed in tasks such as gene synonym identification, protein-protein interaction identification and disease gene identification using a variety of manually assembled 'gold standard' text corpuses. Its f-measure on these tasks is 88, 81 and 79\%, respectively. These values are between 5 and 50\% better than other published tools.

Hepatic SNF5 deletion caused neonatal death due to severe hypoglycemia; mutant animals fail to store glycogen and have impaired energetic metabolism. The formation of a hepatic epithelium is also affected in SNF5-deficient livers. Transcriptome analyses showed that SNF5 inactivation is accompanied by defective transcriptional activation of 70\% of the genes that are normally upregulated during liver development. These include genes involved in glycogen synthesis, gluconeogenesis and cell-cell adhesion. A fraction of hepatic developmentally activated genes were normally expressed, suggesting that cell differentiation was not completely blocked. Moreover, SNF5-deleted cells showed increased proliferation and we identified several misexpressed genes that may contribute to cell cycle deregulation in these cells.

The receptor for AGEs (RAGE) is a multiligand receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface molecules acting as counter-receptor for these diverse molecules. Engagement of RAGE converts a brief pulse of cellular activation to sustained cellular dysfunction and tissue destruction. The involvement of RAGE in pathophysiologic processes has been demonstrated in murine models of chronic disease using either a receptor decoy such as soluble RAGE (sRAGE), RAGE neutralizing antibodies, or a dominant-negative form of the receptor. Studies with RAGE−/− mice confirmed that RAGE contributes, at least in part, to the development of late diabetic complications, such as neuropathy and nephropathy, macrovascular disease, and chronic inflammation. Furthermore, deletion of RAGE provided protection from the lethal effects of septic shock caused by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). In contrast, deletion of RAGE had no effect on the host response in delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH). Despite the lack of effect seen in adaptive immunity by the deletion of RAGE, administration of the receptor decoy, sRAGE, still afforded a protective effect in RAGE−/− mice. Thus, sRAGE is likely to sequester ligands, thereby preventing their interaction with other receptors in addition to RAGE. These data suggest that, just as RAGE is a multiligand receptor, its ligands are also likely to recognize several receptors in mediating their biologic effects.},

The level of the immunohistochemical expression of the S100 proteins was quantitatively determined in the solid tumor tissue (tumor mass). In addition twenty blood vessel walls and their corresponding perivascular tumor astrocytes were also immunohistochemically assayed for 10 cases chosen at random from each of the four histopathological groups. The data showed modifications in the level of S100A3 protein expression; these modifications clearly identified the pilocytic astrocytomas from WHO grade II-IV astrocytic tumors as a distinct biological group. Modifications in the level of S100A6 protein expression enabled a clear distinction to be made between low (WHO grade I and II) and high (WHO grade III and IV) grade astrocytic tumors. Very significant modifications occurred in the level of S100A1 protein expression (and, to a lesser extent, in their of the S100A4 and S100B proteins) in relation to the increasing levels of malignancy. While the S100A5 protein was significantly expressed in all the astrocytic tumors (but without any significant modifications in the levels of malignancy), the S100A2 protein was never expressed in these tumors.

	abstract = {The S100A4(mts1) protein stimulates metastatic spread of tumor cells. An elevated expression of S100A4 is associated with poor prognosis in many human cancers. Dynamics of tumor development were studied in S100A4-deficient mice using grafts of CSML100, highly metastatic mouse mammary carcinoma cells. A significant delay in tumor uptake and decreased tumor incidences were observed in S100A4(-/-) mice compared with the wild-type controls. Moreover, tumors developed in S100A4(-/-) mice never metastasize. Immunohistochemical analyses of these tumors revealed reduced vascularity and abnormal distribution of host-derived stroma cells. Coinjection of CSML100 cells with immortalized S100A4(+/+) fibroblasts partially restored the dynamics of tumor development and the ability to form metastasis. These fibroblasts were characterized by an enhanced motility and invasiveness in comparison with S100A4(-/-) fibroblasts, as well as by the ability to release S100A4 into the tumor environment. Taken together, our results point to a determinative role of host-derived stroma cells expressing S100A4 in tumor progression and metastasis.},

This paper describes two pathways analysis tools, ArrayUnlock and Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) to deal with the post-analyses of microarray data, in the context of the EADGENE and SABRE post-analysis workshop. Dataset employed in this study proceeded from an experimental chicken infection performed to study the host reactions after a homologous or heterologous secondary challenge with two species of Eimeria.
RESULTS: Analysis of the same microarray data source employing both commercial pathway analysis tools in parallel let to identify several biological and/or molecular functions altered in the chicken Eimeria maxima infection model, including several immune system related pathways. Biological functions differentially altered in the homologous and heterologous second infection were identified. Similarly, the effect of the timing in a homologous second infection was characterized by several biological functions.
CONCLUSION: Functional analysis with ArrayUnlock and IPA provided information related to functional differences with the three comparisons of the chicken infection leading to similar conclusions. ArrayUnlock let an improvement of the annotations of the chicken genome adding InterPro annotations to the data set file. IPA provides two powerful tools to understand the pathway analysis results: the networks and canonical pathways that showed several pathways related to an adaptative immune response.},

About 20\% of the blood DNA sequencing reads matched the tumor DNA reads at the SMARCB1 gene locus. Circulating, tumor-specific DNA aberrations are a promising biomarker for atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor patients.

Of 51 myoepithelial carcinomas of soft tissue in the literature, 11 occurred in children, 7 of which were included in a previous series of myoepithelial tumors from our group. We have collected an additional 22 cases of myoepithelial carcinoma of soft tissue in the pediatric population, and we describe the detailed clinicopathologic features of all 29 cases herein. There were 15 girls and 14 boys; age at diagnosis ranged from newborn to 17 years (median, 9 y). Sites included extremities (14 cases), trunk (6 cases), viscera (5 cases: 3 mediastinal, 1 retroperitoneal, and 1 intracardiac), and head/neck (4 cases). Histologically, the tumors were heterogeneous, with epithelioid, clear, spindle and/or plasmacytoid cells forming nests, cords or solid sheets in a myxoid or hyalinized stroma. Epithelioid cells predominated in the majority of cases (27 of 29; 93\%) and in 10 cases (34\%), tumor cells focally had scant cytoplasm with round cell morphology. The mitotic rate ranged from {\textless}1 to 68 per 10 high power fields (median, 8), and tumor necrosis was present in 14 cases. At least 1 broad-spectrum cytokeratin was positive in all tumors [CAM5.2 in 17 of 18 (94\%), AE1/AE3 in 15 of 20 (75\%), and PAN-K in 14 of 21 (67\%)], and EMA was positive in 19 of 29 cases (66\%). Either S100 or GFAP was positive in all but 4 cases [S100 in 21 of 29 (72\%) and GFAP in 15 of 28 (54\%)]. Clinical follow-up in 23 cases revealed that 9 patients had local recurrences (53\% of the 17 patients who underwent complete excision with negative margins); 12 (52\%) developed metastases; and 10 (43\%) have died of disease so far, at a median interval of 9 months after diagnosis. Despite the relative rarity of carcinomas in the pediatric population, myoepithelial carcinoma seems to be disproportionately common among children and often has an aggressive clinical course.},

	abstract = {Malignant rhabdoid tumor has traditionally been defined by its histologic phenotype. However, genetic investigations of malignant rhabdoid tumor have revealed a characteristic loss of or mutation in the INI1 gene on chromosome 22q. The occurrence and significance of soft tissue tumors meeting genetic criteria for malignant rhabdoid tumor but with an undifferentiated non-rhabdoid histology is poorly characterized. Seventeen undifferentiated sarcomas, lacking rhabdoid histology were identified either through the surgical pathology files of The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (1980-2005) or in consultation. Immunohistochemistry for the INI1 protein showed a loss of nuclear expression within tumor cells in five of these cases. On histologic review, these five tumors had a featureless sheet-like architecture; four were small round blue cell tumors, and one showed focal spindling. Although they had variably prominent nucleoli, classic rhabdoid morphologic features were not identified in any of these cases at primary presentation. Additional immunohistochemistry showed a polyphenotypic profile. Four of the five tumors showed genetic abnormalities involving the INI1 gene by a combination of fluorescent in situ hybridization, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and/or mutational analysis. Patient ages ranged from 1 week to 5 years. Four patients were male, and one was female. Sites included two neck tumors, two extremity tumors, and one paraspinal tumor. Two patients are alive and well over 15 years from the time of diagnosis; the remaining four are alive and well but with less than 2 years follow-up. Thus, alterations of the INI1 gene with consequent loss of expression identified a population of undifferentiated sarcomas lacking classic rhabdoid morphology in young patients, with evidence of favorable survival. Whether these undifferentiated sarcomas represent a clinicopathologic entity distinct from classic malignant rhabdoid tumor requires further investigation.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Array CGH technologies enable the simultaneous measurement of DNA copy number for thousands of sites on a genome. We developed the circular binary segmentation (CBS) algorithm to divide the genome into regions of equal copy number. The algorithm tests for change-points using a maximal t-statistic with a permutation reference distribution to obtain the corresponding P-value. The number of computations required for the maximal test statistic is O(N2), where N is the number of markers. This makes the full permutation approach computationally prohibitive for the newer arrays that contain tens of thousands markers and highlights the need for a faster algorithm.
Results: We present a hybrid approach to obtain the P-value of the test statistic in linear time. We also introduce a rule for stopping early when there is strong evidence for the presence of a change. We show through simulations that the hybrid approach provides a substantial gain in speed with only a negligible loss in accuracy and that the stopping rule further increases speed. We also present the analyses of array CGH data from breast cancer cell lines to show the impact of the new approaches on the analysis of real data.
Availability: An R version of the CBS algorithm has been implemented in the “DNAcopy” package of the Bioconductor project. The proposed hybrid method for the P-value is available in version 1.2.1 or higher and the stopping rule for declaring a change early is available in version 1.5.1 or higher.

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.
RESULTS: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is approximately 10-20x faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package.

	abstract = {Infection is the invasion of the host by microorganisms, which then multiply in close association with the host's tissues. Infection is distinguished from disease, a morbid process that does not necessarily involve infection (diabetes, for example, is a disease with no known causative agent). Bacteria can cause a multitude of different infections, ranging in severity from inapparent to fulminating. Table 7-1 lists these types of infections. The capacity of a bacterium to cause disease reflects its relative pathogenicity. On this basis, bacteria can be organized into three major groups. When isolated from a patient, frank or primary pathogens are considered to be probable agents of disease (e.g., when the cause of diarrheal disease is identified by the laboratory isolation of Salmonella spp. from feces). Opportunistic pathogens are those isolated from patients whose host defense mechanisms have been compromised. They may be the agents of disease (e.g., in patients who have been predisposed to urinary tract infections with Escherichia coli by catheterization). Finally, some bacteria, such as Lactobacillus acidophilus, are considered to be nonpathogens, because they rarely or never cause human disease. Their categorization as nonpathogens may change, however, because of the adaptability of bacteria and the detrimental effect of modern radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy on resistance mechanisms. In fact, some bacteria previously considered to be nonpathogens are now known to cause disease. Serratia marcescens, for example, is a common soil bacterium that causes pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and bacteremia in compromised hosts. Virulence is the measure of the pathogenicity of an organism. The degree of virulence is related directly to the ability of the organism to cause disease despite host resistance mechanisms; it is affected by numerous variables such as the number of infecting bacteria, route of entry into the body, specific and nonspecific host defense mechanisms, and virulence factors of the bacterium. Virulence can be measured experimentally by determining the number of bacteria required to cause animal death, illness, or lesions in a defined period after the bacteria are administered by a designated route. Consequently, calculations of a lethal dose affecting 50 percent of a population of animals (LD50) or an effective dose causing a disease symptom in 50 percent of a population of animals (ED50) are useful in comparing the relative virulence of different bacteria. Pathogenesis refers both to the mechanism of infection and to the mechanism by which disease develops. The purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of the many bacterial virulence factors and, where possible, to indicate how they interact with host defense mechanisms and to describe their role in the pathogenesis of disease. It should be understood that the pathogenic mechanisms of many bacterial diseases are poorly understood, while those of others have been probed at the molecular level. The relative importance of an infectious disease to the health of humans and animals does not always coincide with the depth of our understanding of its pathogenesis. This information is best acquired by reading each of the ensuing chapters on specific bacterial diseases, infectious disease texts, and public health bulletins.},

	abstract = {Cellular senescence, an irreversible cell-cycle arrest, reflects a safeguard program that limits the proliferative capacity of the cell exposed to endogenous or exogenous stress signals. A number of recent studies have clarified that an acutely inducible form of cellular senescence may act in response to oncogenic activation as a natural barrier to interrupt tumorigenesis at a premalignant level. Paralleling the increasing insights into premature senescence as a tumor suppressor mechanism, a growing line of evidence identifies cellular senescence as a critical effector program in response to DNA damaging chemotherapeutic agents. This review discusses molecular pathways to stress-induced senescence, the interference of a terminal arrest condition with clinical outcome, and the critical overlap between premature senescence and apoptosis as both tumor suppressive and drug-responsive cellular programs.},

	abstract = {Dehydration or desiccation is one of the most frequent and severe challenges to living cells. The bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans is the best known extremophile among the few organisms that can survive extremely high exposures to desiccation and ionizing radiation, which shatter its genome into hundreds of short DNA fragments. Remarkably, these fragments are readily reassembled into a functional 3.28-megabase genome. Here we describe the relevant two-stage DNA repair process, which involves a previously unknown molecular mechanism for fragment reassembly called 'extended synthesis-dependent strand annealing' (ESDSA), followed and completed by crossovers. At least two genome copies and random DNA breakage are requirements for effective ESDSA. In ESDSA, chromosomal fragments with overlapping homologies are used both as primers and as templates for massive synthesis of complementary single strands, as occurs in a single-round multiplex polymerase chain reaction. This synthesis depends on DNA polymerase I and incorporates more nucleotides than does normal replication in intact cells. Newly synthesized complementary single-stranded extensions become 'sticky ends' that anneal with high precision, joining together contiguous DNA fragments into long, linear, double-stranded intermediates. These intermediates require RecA-dependent crossovers to mature into circular chromosomes that comprise double-stranded patchworks of numerous DNA blocks synthesized before radiation, connected by DNA blocks synthesized after radiation.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: When running experiments that involve multiple high density oligonucleotide arrays, it is important to remove sources of variation between arrays of non-biological origin. Normalization is a process for reducing this variation. It is common to see non-linear relations between arrays and the standard normalization provided by Affymetrix does not perform well in these situations.
RESULTS: We present three methods of performing normalization at the probe intensity level. These methods are called complete data methods because they make use of data from all arrays in an experiment to form the normalizing relation. These algorithms are compared to two methods that make use of a baseline array: a one number scaling based algorithm and a method that uses a non-linear normalizing relation by comparing the variability and bias of an expression measure. Two publicly available datasets are used to carry out the comparisons. The simplest and quickest complete data method is found to perform favorably.
AVAILABILITY: Software implementing all three of the complete data normalization methods is available as part of the R package Affy, which is a part of the Bioconductor project http://www.bioconductor.org.

In the past, estimates of mutation rates have generally been inferred from phenotypic observations or comparisons of homologous sequences among closely related species. Here, we apply new sequencing technology to measure directly one mutation rate, that of base substitutions on the human Y chromosome. The Y chromosomes of two individuals separated by 13 generations were flow sorted and sequenced by Illumina (Solexa) paired-end sequencing to an average depth of 11x or 20x, respectively. Candidate mutations were further examined by capillary sequencing in cell-line and blood DNA from the donors and additional family members. Twelve mutations were confirmed in approximately 10.15 Mb; eight of these had occurred in vitro and four in vivo. The latter could be placed in different positions on the pedigree and led to a mutation-rate measurement of 3.0 x 10(-8) mutations/nucleotide/generation (95\% CI: 8.9 x 10(-9)-7.0 x 10(-8)), consistent with estimates of 2.3 x 10(-8)-6.3 x 10(-8) mutations/nucleotide/generation for the same Y-chromosomal region from published human-chimpanzee comparisons depending on the generation and split times assumed.},

Here we conduct a study of genome-wide mutation rates by sequencing the entire genomes of 78 Icelandic parent-offspring trios at high coverage. We show that in our samples, with an average father's age of 29.7, the average de novo mutation rate is 1.20 × 10(-8) per nucleotide per generation. Most notably, the diversity in mutation rate of single nucleotide polymorphisms is dominated by the age of the father at conception of the child. The effect is an increase of about two mutations per year. An exponential model estimates paternal mutations doubling every 16.5 years. After accounting for random Poisson variation, father's age is estimated to explain nearly all of the remaining variation in the de novo mutation counts. These observations shed light on the importance of the father's age on the risk of diseases such as schizophrenia and autism.},

	abstract = {The mutation rate (μ) is a key biological feature of somatic cells that determines risk for malignant transformation, and it has been exceedingly difficult to measure in human cells. For this purpose, a potential sentinel is the X-linked PIG-A gene, because its inactivation causes lack of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked membrane proteins. We previously found that the frequency (f) of PIG-A mutant cells can be measured accurately by flow cytometry, even when f is very low. Here we measure both f and μ by culturing B-lymphoblastoid cell lines and first eliminating preexisting PIG-A mutants by flow sorting. After expansion in culture, the frequency of new mutants is determined by flow cytometry using antibodies specific for glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked proteins (e.g., CD48, CD55, and CD59). The mutation rate is then calculated by the formula μ = f/d, where d is the number of cell divisions occurring in culture. The mean μ in cells from normal donors was 10.6 × 10−7 mutations per cell division (range 2.4 to 29.6 × 10−7). The mean μ was elevated {\textgreater}30-fold in cells from patients with Fanconi anemia (P {\textless} 0.0001), and μ varied widely in ataxia-telangiectasia with a mean 4-fold elevation (P = 0.002). In contrast, μ was not significantly different from normal in cells from patients with Nijmegen breakage syndrome. Differences in μ could not be attributed to variations in plating efficiency. The mutation rate in man can now be measured routinely in B-lymphoblastoid cell lines, and it is elevated in cancer predisposition syndromes. This system should be useful in evaluating cancer risk and in the design of preventive strategies.},

	abstract = {Object Focal hemosiderin deposition (FHD) is commonly observed on brain MRI scans of patients treated for childhood medulloblastoma (MB). The authors sought to determine the clinical significance of FHD and its relationship to patient age, radiation dose, and cognitive outcomes. Methods A single-institution retrospective study of 93 MB patients at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford from 1998 to 2011 identified 41 patients with a negative baseline MRI scan and at least 2 posttreatment MRI scans obtained with T2* gradient recalled echo (GRE). The number and cumulative rate of FHDs detectable by GRE were compared between patients aged 6 years and younger (early age) and aged 7-21 years (late age) at the time of radiotherapy (RT) and between low-dose (1800-2340 cGy) and high-dose (2920-3960 cGy) RT. Results The median age at MB diagnosis was 7.3 years (range 0.9-21.0 years), the median clinical follow-up period was 5.8 years (range 0.8-13.4 years), and the median 5-year overall survival was 81\% ± 7\%. Of 30 school-aged children with MB, 21 (70\%) required special education, and the median IQ of 10 tested patients was 100 (range 50-118). Thirty-three patients (80\%) had FHD after a median latency of 1.9 years (range 0.1-5.9 years). Ninety-four percent (436 of 466) of the lesions arose in the supratentorial region of the brain, whereas 29 (6\%) resided in the brainstem or the cerebellum. No spinal lesions were observed on routine spine MRI scans using T2 fast spin echo imaging. The mean cumulative lesion rate per year was 2.23 ± 3.05, and this rate was higher in older children at the time of RT compared with younger children (3.23 vs 0.67 per year, p = 0.002) but did not differ among different RT doses (p = 0.395). A child's IQ or need for special education showed no significant correlation with the rate of lesion development or number of lesions. None of the lesions resulted in symptomatic hemorrhage that required surgical intervention. Conclusions More FHD was observed in children treated for MB at the older ages than in those treated at the younger ages. There was no significant association of the incidence of FHD with radiation dose or cognitive outcomes, and none of the lesions required surgical intervention.},

	abstract = {The clinicopathological features of atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor, a new entity among malignant pediatric brain tumors, and the differential diagnosis from primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET)/medulloblastoma, and germ cell tumor are described. Histologically, atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor is defined as a polymorphous neoplasm often featuring rhabdoid, PNET, epithelial, and mesenchymal components. Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors usually include PNET components and occur mainly in the posterior fossa, so mimic medulloblastoma. Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor is characterized by the cytogenetic finding of monosomy 22 rather than i(17q). The tumor is similarly mistaken for PNET at supratentorial sites. Germ cell tumors also enter into the differential diagnosis due to their histological immunophenotypic diversity, particularly features indicative of epithelial and mesenchymal differentiation. Nonetheless, the remarkable spectrum of tissues that typify teratoma is absent in atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor. The same is true of germ cell marker in tumor tissues and serum. The prognosis of atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor is far less favorable than that of PNET/medulloblastoma of malignant or germ cell tumor. Meta-analysis of 133 cases, including 15 new and 118 reported cases, confirm that atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor is as a clinicopathological entity and emphasizes the necessity for distinguishing this unique tumor from other pediatric central nervous system neoplasms.},

By using models of the cortical surface and sulcal landmarks and a statistical model for gray matter density, human cortical development could be visualized across the age range in a spatiotemporally detailed time-lapse sequence. The resulting time-lapse “movies” reveal that (i) higher-order association cortices mature only after lower-order somatosensory and visual cortices, the functions of which they integrate, are developed, and (ii) phylogenetically older brain areas mature earlier than newer ones.

	abstract = {Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common pediatric brain malignancy within which there are four different molecular subtypes (WNT, SHH, Group 3 and Group 4). These subtypes are useful in stratifying risk in patients and for guiding the development of targeted therapies. We subtyped 74 primary pediatric MBs using the NanoString nCounter platform and discovered that patients with the SHH subtype were the most likely to relapse and die from the disease. Therefore, we interrogated a library of targeted small-molecule inhibitors that are currently in clinical development to address whether any of them suppressed growth of SHH subtype MB cells. Polo-Like Kinase (PLK) inhibitors represented 6 of the 16 most potent inhibitors identified in this screen. High levels of PLK1 mRNA were prognostic for relapse and poor patient survival. Notably, PLK1 expression was highest in the SHH subtype. The levels of PLK1 mRNA were higher in MB compared to normal cerebellum and differentiated cells such as neurons and astrocytes. In patient-derived MBs, PLK1 small-molecule inhibitor BI2536 suppressed the self-renewal of PLK1-high but not PLK1-low expressing MB cells. Likewise, PLK1 inhibition stopped the proliferation of MB cell lines, induced cell cycle arrest, prevented self-renewal and provoked apoptosis. In contrast, the growth of human neural stem cells was unaffected by BI2536. Finally, BI2536 extended survival in MB-bearing mice and the efficacy was comparable to standard-of care chemotherapy protocols such as the Headstart regimen. To conclude, PLK1 is a new molecular target for MB with application to the SHH subtype.},

A nestin-ΔTK-IRES-GFP (Nes-ΔTK-GFP) transgene that labels quiescent subventricular zone adult neural stem cells also labels a subset of endogenous glioma tumour cells. On arrest of tumour cell proliferation with TMZ, pulse-chase experiments demonstrate a tumour re-growth cell hierarchy originating with the Nes-ΔTK-GFP transgene subpopulation. Ablation of the GFP+ cells with chronic ganciclovir administration significantly arrested tumour growth, and combined TMZ and ganciclovir treatment impeded tumour development. Thus, a relatively quiescent subset of endogenous glioma cells, with properties similar to those proposed for cancer stem cells, is responsible for sustaining long-term tumour growth through the production of transient populations of highly proliferative cells.},

	abstract = {Malignant gliomas are characterized by a short median survival which is largely impacted by the resistance of these tumors tochemo- and radiotherapy. Recent studies suggest that a small subpopulation of cancer stem cells, which are highly resistant to gamma-radiation, has the capacity to repopulate the tumors and contribute to their malignant progression. gamma-radiation activates the process of autophagy and inhibition of this process increases the radiosensitivity of glioma cells; however, the role of autophagy in the resistance of glioma stem cells (GSCs) to radiation has not been yet reported. In this study we examined the induction of autophagy by gamma-radiation in CD133+ GSCs. Irradiation of CD133+ cells induced autophagy within 24-48 hr and slightly decreased the viability of the cells. gamma-radiation induced a larger degree of autophagy in the CD133+ cells as compared with CD133- cells and the CD133+ cells expressed higher levels of the autophagy-related proteins LC3, ATG5 and ATG12. The autophagy inhibitor bafilomycin A1 and silencing of ATG5 and beclin1 sensitized the CD133+ cells to gamma-radiation and significantly decreased the viability of the irradiated cells and their ability to form neurospheres. Collectively, these results indicate that the induction of autophagy contributes to the radioresistance of these cells and autophagy inhibitors may be employed to increase the sensitivity of CD133+ GSCs to gamma-radiation.},

Here, we show that the dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitor PI-103 induces autophagy in a form of glioma that is resistant to therapy. Inhibitors of autophagosome maturation cooperated with PI-103 to induce apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway, indicating that the cellular self-digestion process of autophagy acted as a survival signal in this setting. Not all inhibitors of mTOR synergized with inhibitors of autophagy. Rapamycin delivered alone induced autophagy, yet cells survived inhibition of autophagosome maturation because of rapamycin-mediated activation of Akt. In contrast, adenosine 5'-triphosphate-competitive inhibitors of mTOR stimulated autophagy more potently than did rapamycin, with inhibition of mTOR complexes 1 and 2 contributing independently to induction of autophagy. We show that combined inhibition of PI3K and mTOR, which activates autophagy without activating Akt, cooperated with inhibition of autophagy to cause glioma cells to undergo apoptosis. Moreover, the PI3K-mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235, which is in clinical use, synergized with the lysosomotropic inhibitor of autophagy, chloroquine, another agent in clinical use, to induce apoptosis in glioma xenografts in vivo, providing a therapeutic approach potentially translatable to humans.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2004, a randomised phase III trial by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group (NCIC) reported improved median and 2-year survival for patients with glioblastoma treated with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide and radiotherapy. We report the final results with a median follow-up of more than 5 years.
METHODS: Adult patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma were randomly assigned to receive either standard radiotherapy or identical radiotherapy with concomitant temozolomide followed by up to six cycles of adjuvant temozolomide. The methylation status of the methyl-guanine methyl transferase gene, MGMT, was determined retrospectively from the tumour tissue of 206 patients. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT00006353.
FINDINGS: Between Aug 17, 2000, and March 22, 2002, 573 patients were assigned to treatment. 278 (97\%) of 286 patients in the radiotherapy alone group and 254 (89\%) of 287 in the combined-treatment group died during 5 years of follow-up. Overall survival was 27.2\% (95\% CI 22.2-32.5) at 2 years, 16.0\% (12.0-20.6) at 3 years, 12.1\% (8.5-16.4) at 4 years, and 9.8\% (6.4-14.0) at 5 years with temozolomide, versus 10.9\% (7.6-14.8), 4.4\% (2.4-7.2), 3.0\% (1.4-5.7), and 1.9\% (0.6-4.4) with radiotherapy alone (hazard ratio 0.6, 95\% CI 0.5-0.7; p{\textless}0.0001). A benefit of combined therapy was recorded in all clinical prognostic subgroups, including patients aged 60-70 years. Methylation of the MGMT promoter was the strongest predictor for outcome and benefit from temozolomide chemotherapy.
INTERPRETATION: Benefits of adjuvant temozolomide with radiotherapy lasted throughout 5 years of follow-up. A few patients in favourable prognostic categories survive longer than 5 years. MGMT methylation status identifies patients most likely to benefit from the addition of temozolomide.

For many applications, a global view of all the available interaction data is desirable, including lower-quality data and/or computational predictions. The STRING database (http://string-db.org/) aims to provide such a global perspective for as many organisms as feasible. Known and predicted associations are scored and integrated, resulting in comprehensive protein networks covering {\textgreater}1100 organisms.

	abstract = {Motivation: Tumorigenesis is an evolutionary process by which tumor cells acquire sequences of mutations leading to increased growth, invasiveness and eventually metastasis. It is hoped that by identifying the common patterns of mutations underlying major cancer sub-types, we can better understand the molecular basis of tumor development and identify new diagnostics and therapeutic targets. This goal has motivated several attempts to apply evolutionary tree reconstruction methods to assays of tumor state. Inference of tumor evolution is in principle aided by the fact that tumors are heterogeneous, retaining remnant populations of different stages along their development along with contaminating healthy cell populations. In practice, though, this heterogeneity complicates interpretation of tumor data because distinct cell types are conflated by common methods for assaying the tumor state. We previously proposed a method to computationally infer cell populations from measures of tumor-wide gene expression through a geometric interpretation of mixture type separation, but this approach deals poorly with noisy and outlier data.
Results: In the present work, we propose a new method to perform tumor mixture separation efficiently and robustly to an experimental error. The method builds on the prior geometric approach but uses a novel objective function allowing for robust fits that greatly reduces the sensitivity to noise and outliers. We further develop an efficient gradient optimization method to optimize this ‘soft geometric unmixing’ objective for measurements of tumor DNA copy numbers assessed by array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) data. We show, on a combination of semi-synthetic and real data, that the method yields fast and accurate separation of tumor states.
Conclusions: We have shown a novel objective function and optimization method for the robust separation of tumor sub-types from aCGH data and have shown that the method provides fast, accurate reconstruction of tumor states from mixed samples. Better solutions to this problem can be expected to improve our ability to accurately identify genetic abnormalities in primary tumor samples and to infer patterns of tumor evolution.

	abstract = {Multistage carcinogenesis is an important concept in cancer biology. Each new stage is triggered by the acquisition of an additional genetic aberration, leading to clonal expansion of the cancer cell. The resulting tumor mass consists of cancer cells with all genetic aberrations, but may include precursor cells at some point of carcinogenesis. We analyzed six colorectal cancer tissues with APC, K-ras, and p53 mutations. From each sample, 40-50 areas (100x100x40microm) consisting only of cancer cells were microdissected, and genomic DNA was purified. Ratios of mutated and normal alleles were quantitated by the SNaPshot assay, a primer extension assay. In five tumor tissues, we identified cancer cell subpopulations corresponding to putative precursors, i.e., cells with mutations in one or two of the three genes. All samples were likely to be of monoclonal origin, and temporal sequences of the mutations could be deduced from the mutation patterns of putative precursors. The orders of mutation events were variable. However, the two carcinoma tissues accompanying adenoma regions started with the APC mutation, not contradicting the previous studies. The analysis also revealed considerable heterogeneity in allele ratios of one or two of the chromosomes. The current findings are promising to uncover the process of carcinogenesis directly from the tumor tissue of the patient.},

The unprecedented throughput and relatively short read lengths of Roche/454, Illumina/Solexa, and other platforms have spurred development of a new generation of sequence alignment algorithms. Yet detection of sequence variants based on short read alignments remains challenging, and most currently available tools are limited to a single platform or aligner type. We present VarScan, an open source tool for variant detection that is compatible with several short read aligners. We demonstrate VarScan's ability to detect SNPs and indels with high sensitivity and specificity, in both Roche/454 sequencing of individuals and deep Illumina/Solexa sequencing of pooled samples.

	abstract = {Primary triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), a tumour type defined by lack of oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and ERBB2 gene amplification, represent approximately 16\% of all breast cancers. Here we show in 104 TNBC cases that at the time of diagnosis these cancers exhibit a wide and continuous spectrum of genomic evolution, with some having only a handful of coding somatic aberrations in a few pathways, whereas others contain hundreds of coding somatic mutations. High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that only approximately 36\% of mutations are expressed. Using deep re-sequencing measurements of allelic abundance for 2,414 somatic mutations, we determine for the first time-to our knowledge-in an epithelial tumour subtype, the relative abundance of clonal frequencies among cases representative of the population. We show that TNBCs vary widely in their clonal frequencies at the time of diagnosis, with the basal subtype of TNBC showing more variation than non-basal TNBC. Although p53 (also known as TP53), PIK3CA and PTEN somatic mutations seem to be clonally dominant compared to other genes, in some tumours their clonal frequencies are incompatible with founder status. Mutations in cytoskeletal, cell shape and motility proteins occurred at lower clonal frequencies, suggesting that they occurred later during tumour progression. Taken together, our results show that understanding the biology and therapeutic responses of patients with TNBC will require the determination of individual tumour clonal genotypes.},

Currently, therapeutic, drug-induced differentiation is considered as a promising approach to eradicate this tumor-driving cell population; retinoic acid is well known as a potent modulator of differentiation and proliferation in normal stem cells. In glioma, knowledge about the efficacy of retinoic acid-induced differentiation to target the stem-like tumor cell pool could have therapeutic implications.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Stem-like glioma cells (SLGC) were differentiated with all-trans retinoic acid-containing medium to study the effect of differentiation on angiogenesis, invasive growth, as well as radioresistance and chemoresistance of SLGCs. In vivo effects were studied using live microscopy in a cranial window model.
RESULTS: Our data suggest that in vitro differentiation of SLGCs induces therapy-sensitizing effects, impairs the secretion of angiogenic cytokines, and disrupts SLGCs motility. Further, ex vivo differentiation reduces tumorigenicity of SLGCs. Finally, we show that all-trans retinoic acid treatment alone can induce antitumor effects in vivo.
CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, these results highlight the potential of differentiation treatment to target the stem-like cell population in glioblastoma.},

Chromosomal imbalances significantly differed among glioblastomas; the only alterations that were observed in {\textgreater} or =6 cases were loss of chromosome 10q, gain at 7p and loss of 10p. Genetic alterations common to all areas analyzed within a single tumor included gains at 1q32.1 (PIK3C2B, MDM4), 4q11-q12 (KIT, PDGFRA), 7p12.1-11.2 (EGFR), 12q13.3-12q14.1 (GLI1, CDK4) and 12q15 (MDM2), and loss at 9p21.1-24.3 (p16(INK4a)/p14(ARF)), 10p15.3-q26.3 (PTEN, etc.) and 13q12.11-q34 (SPRY2, RB1).

	abstract = {We have investigated the antigenic heterogeneity of human glioma cells and its correlation with other parameters of tumor cell heterogeneity (karyotype, 2':3' cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphohydrolase expression, in vitro morphology) using the established human glioma cell line D-54 MG and eight single-cell-derived clones. The panel of antibodies used included 3 previously described heterologous sera raised against human gliomas and lamb oligodendroglia and 10 monoclonal antibodies with demonstrated reactivity for tumors of neuroectodermal origin, human fetal tissue, or human Thy-1. Antigen expression was determined by cell surface radioimmunoassay and peroxidase-antiperoxidase immunohistology. The use of a monoclonal antibody panel composed of ten reagents of varied specificity resulted in the demonstration of highly variable and complex antigenic patterns on the cell surfaces of cloned subpopulations of the human glioma cell line D-54 MG. Only one antigen, human Thy-1, was present on the parent line and all clones; the remaining nine antigens exhibited a distribution unrelated to other predictive parameters of genotypic or phenotypic heterogeneity such as karyotype, 2':3' cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphohydrolase expression, or in vitro morphology. With the exception of clones 3 and 4, which shared a common antigen profile but exhibited distinctly different in vitro morphological patterns, the detected antigenic profile of each clone was distinct, with the proportion of expressed antigens ranging from 2 of 10 (clone 2) to 10 of 10 (clone 1). The demonstration of distinct, selectively maintained cell subpopulations within a human glioma cell line has direct implications for immunotherapeutic designs.},

	abstract = {The histological pleomorphism of human malignant gliomas as well as their variable response to therapy suggests that such tumors are not homogeneous but are composed of a heterogeneous population of cells. To search for heterogeneity in these tumors, we developed a protocol to identify by karyotype, isolate, and clone the subpopulations of the tumor. Freshly resected tumors were mechanically dissociated into single cells that were grown in suspension and short-term monolayer cultures. Chromosomal preparations were collected over the first 6 to 72 hr postresection. The karyotypes prepared comprised the "reference set" of chromosomes found in each tumor. The dissociated single cells were also dilution plated for monolayer culture. Cells that attached were marked and isolated as clones whose karyotypes were compared to those in the reference set in order to identify those clones that were cellular representatives of the tumor. Explant cultures established from the same tumor were grown in monolayer culture and cloned; their karyotypes were likewise compared to those in the reference set. Eight gliomas were analyzed. Each had metaphases that ranged in chromosome number from hypodiploid to hyperploid, but the frequency distribution of the subpopulations differed among the tumors. Defining a cellular subpopulation in the tumor as one yielding at least five karyotypically identical cells in the reference set, we found that each tumor contained from three to 21 subpopulations. All but one tumor produced 100 or more clones, and in seven tumors, more than 50\% of the clones could be expanded for karyotyping; 7.6 to 25\% of these clones had karyotypes identifiable in the reference set of their tumor. There was little relationship between the morphology of the clones and their karyotypes or growth kinetics. While explant cultures grew well, no clone derived from such cultures could be identified in the reference set. The protocol permits studies of clonal lines identifiable as cellular representatives of a patient's tumor and not variants generated in tissue culture. These studies confirmed that human malignant gliomas are comprised of karyotypically heterogeneous cellular subpopulations. Preliminary work suggests that their phenotypic behavior may be similarly heterogeneous.},

	abstract = {Glioblastoma (GBM) is distinguished by a high degree of intratumoral heterogeneity, which extends to the pattern of expression and amplification of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Although most GBMs harbor RTK amplifications, clinical trials of small-molecule inhibitors targeting individual RTKs have been disappointing to date. Activation of multiple RTKs within individual GBMs provides a theoretical mechanism of resistance; however, the spectrum of functional RTK dependence among tumor cell subpopulations in actual tumors is unknown. We investigated the pattern of heterogeneity of RTK amplification and functional RTK dependence in GBM tumor cell subpopulations. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas GBM dataset identified 34 of 463 cases showing independent focal amplification of two or more RTKs, most commonly platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRA) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed on eight samples with EGFR and PDGFRA amplification, revealing distinct tumor cell subpopulations amplified for only one RTK; in all cases these predominated over cells amplified for both. Cell lines derived from coamplified tumors exhibited genotype selection under RTK-targeted ligand stimulation or pharmacologic inhibition in vitro. Simultaneous inhibition of both EGFR and PDGFR was necessary for abrogation of PI3 kinase pathway activity in the mixed population. DNA sequencing of isolated subpopulations establishes a common clonal origin consistent with late or ongoing divergence of RTK genotype. This phenomenon is especially common among tumors with PDGFRA amplification: overall, 43\% of PDGFRA-amplified GBM were found to have amplification of EGFR or the hepatocyte growth factor receptor gene (MET) as well.},
